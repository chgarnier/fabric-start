SQuirreL SQL Client Change Log
==============================

Not yet released, available in our GIT repository and in snapshots and future releases.
===============================================================================================

Enhancements:

Introduced Java 11 compatibility.

#570 Cancel option for 'New file', 'Close file' and 'Open file'

Upgraded to latest RSyntax version (2.6.1).

Alias Tree: Sorting now works the same way as column sorting (ascending, descending, former state).

Alias Tree: Improved drag and drop behavior. Sorting now works the same way as column sorting (ascending, descending, former state).

SQL comments are now maintained in SQL history as well as SQL result header and info tab.

SQL Editor: Grouped right mouse entries concerning quotes, see comment in bug #1349.

#567 SQL History dropdown is now sorted youngest to oldest instead of oldest to youngest.

#323 DBCopy-Plugin: The 'Paste table as ...' feature was turned into 'Paste table as/filtered ...' and now allows
  to provide an optional WHERE clause.

Find Alias dialog (ctrl alt shift F) now has a check box to remember the last search string.

Improved layout of upper part of result tab.

New right mouse menu on result tables: 'Copy separated by ...' which opens a small
  configuration dialog to enter cell and row separators and then copies values to clipboard.

Version check message was improved. It was misleading as mentioned in feature request #568.

When a Session tab is renamed the rename dialog's text box now contains the old name.
  Thanks to Chris B for the code.

New toolbar button on the upper right of an SQL result tab: 'Mark duplicate values in columns'
  The mark's brightness alters between succeeding non unique values.

Two new right mouse menus on result tables: 'Color selected rows' and 'Go to color'.

New right mouse menu entries on SQL result tabs: 'close all to left' and 'close all to right'

Added JSON to export formats. See right mouse menu on tables or tools popup (ctrl+t) on SQLs.

Added SAS default driver definition.
 Thanks to Luca Vercelli

Aliases can be colored. This feature for example can be used to mark important Aliases.

Cell data popup dialog --> Browse button now remembers last directory.

Reworked corrections/abbreviations dialog. See Session toolbar button 'Configure auto correct /abreviation'.

#438 The 'Run query output to a file'-feature does now respect the 'Abort on error ...'-property.
  See menu File --> New Session Properties --> tab SQL

#566 Simplified launch scripts by using wildcards to build the classpath.
  This was done for the SQuirreL application and CLI launch scripts.

#438 Run query output to a file by defining the file as part of the SQL statement
  Example:
    @file '/tmp/customers.xlsx' SELECT * FROM customers
  will write the result of 'SELECT * FROM customers' to '/tmp/customers.xlsx'
  The settings for the output will be taken from the 'Store result of SQL to file' dialog.
  Please note the single quotes around the file name.

Allowed Java version 10 in starter scripts.

New right mouse menu entry 'Copy selected rows to new window' available in all tables.
  If windows with with matching column names and column types already exist another pop up menu allows to append
  the selected rows to one of these windows.

#412 Provided Command Line Interface (CLI).
  See Readme.txt in the squirrelcli/ subdirectory of your SQuirreL installation.


Bug fixes:

#1360 Fixed typo in error message

#1358 Window "Value of column" out of sight

#1357 Switching a result set to be editable makes row numbers invisible

Corrected outdated editor information in the Syntax Plugin prefrences UI, see menu File --> New Session Properties --> tab Syntax.


#1315 MySQL: Tables are not listed in Object tree for certain JDBC driver/RDBMS versions

Tree nodes of the 'Show foreign key references' dialog are now shown in alphabetical order.

#1349 Added missing keyboard short cuts to SQL editors right mouse menu.

#1354 Regex filter in SQL history is limited to capital letters
  Thanks to Chris B for the fix.

#1353 Object tree search field's focus can now be transferred using shift+tab

#1352 After "Modify Alias..." a longer Alias name is cut off and displayed with "..." in Aliases tree view

#1348 Shortcut is displayed twice in flyover/tooltip

Reading on SQL results (see combo box on upper right) didn't work when multiple SQLs were executed.

Canceling SQL executions raised NullPointerException.

Editing results didn't work when multiple SQLs were executed using statement separator.

Column search feature: Moving multiple columns to table begin did not work right.

#1282 Session menu now has a scroll bar if it's too long to fit on screen.

Corrections/abbreviations dialog didn't scroll right when new row was added.

DBCopy-Plugin: When 'Paste table as/filtered...' was used before simple 'Paste table' information of the first action were not cleaned.

Reloading last SQL contents (*) did mark the SQL editor dirty i.e. unsaved buffer edits confirm firm was triggered.
  (*) See See menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab SQL --> Section General --> Check box 'Reload last SQL editor contents when Session is opened'

Close confirmations now also work for extra SQL Worksheets (ctrl N).

'New Session Properties' --> tab SQL was not initially scrolled to top.

#1341 Squirrel was started twice by squirrel-sql.bat in the plain zip versions of snapshot-20180406_0118.

Added new alternative to fix MAC OS launch script problem with setting SQUIRREL_SQL_HOME.
  Thanks to Frank Kemmer

MAC launch scripts: Added double quotes to the definition of the IZPACK_JAVA_HOME variable
  as requested by Pete K. in bug #1321

#1337 Version check dialog told Java 8 was needed for version 3.x instead of 3.8.1

#740 The 'Copy as INSERT-VALUES/UPDATE-SET statement' functions generate 'PressCtrlH' instead of table name.
  This problem is not generally solvable. Improvements were implemented to provide a table name in more occasions.
  Note: PressCtrlH is meant to be a hint to use the editor's replace function to correct a generated script.

#565 Double clicking selection should stop at '=' '>' '<' chars.

Improved repaint behavior when rows are deleted in a table.

Fixed NullPointer in the 'Show foreign key references' feature. (See right mouse menu of SQL results.)

#1334 The 'Limit read' feature of CHAR, VARCHAR, LONGVARCHAR type columns was declared unstable,
  see menu File --> Global preferences --> tab Data type controls --> section CHAR, VARCHAR, LONGVARCHAR.
  Corresponding Errors are now clearly telling about the instability.

SQLs that used double quoted table or schema names do now have a chance to be identified as editable.


Fix problem in RotatedTableCtrl with rawtype columns (BINARY, VARBINARY,(VAR)CHAR FOR BIT DATA, BLOB)
 Thanks to Stefan Mueller for the patch.

#1330 Plugin SQLReplace does not function in SQL Worksheets (ctrl+n)
  Also added a small help file for the Plugin.

Recent file feature: Files were not loaded.


3.8.1 (12/29/2017)
==================


Enhancements:

Launch script improvements:
 - Several improvements to the MAC launch scripts provided by Harry Evans in bug #1321.
 - '-Xmx256m' was removed from all scripts as a consequence of Java 1.8 being required.

Display of current schema in a Session tab's status bar / Option to set the schema.
  The JDBC API methods to do this were introduced with Java 1.7 and currently do not work for all drivers/RDBMSes
  NOTE: WITH THIS CHANGE SQUIRREL REQUIRES Java 8.

#532 Increased maximum font size of SQL editor: Maximum was 14 and is now 28.
  See menu File --> New Session Properties --> tab SQL --> Section SQL Entry Area

INSERT/data scripts can now be created from multiple SQL statements instead of from just on statement.
  Thanks to  Daniel Str√§nger for the merge request.

Columns of SQL results can be searched for by a new tool bar button on the upper right of the result tab.

Introduced Java 9 compatibility at the cost of loosing recent file history ones.
  A warning is issued the points to the XML file where the former version history can be found.

#558 New toolbar button: 'File reload'

New find Alias dialog to find and connect to Aliases, use shortcut ctrl alt shift F

The combo box of the SQL result table find function now has an 'exact' entry.

Added SQLLite default driver definition.
 Thanks to Chris Papps

Added default driver definitions for OpenEdge and older 9.1E and 10.0B Progress databases.
 Thanks to Tinco van Engen


Bug fixes:

#1327 Postgres Plugin: Sequence details are not fetched on PostgreSQL 10+

#1099 Mac OS: Introduced Harry Evans' application name fix to the Mac OS launch script.

#1324 SQL script generation corrupts data when remapping newlines.

Fixed two minor issues of the SQL results column search feature:
  - When columns were moved and table was made editable the first moved column reappeared at its former position.
  - If different tables occur in a SQL result and if your RDBMS/driver gives access to SQL results table names
    then columns' will be qualified in the column search dialog.

#1323 Fixed compile bugs when compiling with Java 9

Fixed Java 9 compatibility issue concerning the JavaBeans Activation Framework:
  javax.activation.jar was added to our libs following Bill Shannon's suggestion here https://github.com/javaee/javamail/issues/266
  The jar was downloaded here https://github.com/javaee/activation


Mac scripts where changed according to the comment of Nov. 18. 2017 in bug #1321.
  This change contradicts the change made for bug #1310.
  Since there seems to be no version that works for all Mac users
  the problem is well documented in the script itself
  to allow users to change the script and to try out which version works for them.


#1321 Scripts for the plain zip releases are updated and now match the installer versions.
 Please note that there are now separate scripts for Linux/Unix and Mac.
 While the installers automatically come with the right script
 the plain zip packages now contain squirrel-sql.sh for Linux/Unix and squirrel-sql-mac.sh for the Mac.

For some databases schema loading took long even if schema loading was configured to ignore most schemas.
  Those databases, e.g. Oracle, take long to execute DatabaseMetaData.getTables(..., String[] tablesTypes)
  even if the tablesTypes array is empty.

When column display size (ResultSetMetaData.getColumnDisplaySize()) was a very large value
 the column width in result tables turned out to be very small. Seen on Postgres.


#1317 Oracle type INTERVALDS not properly displayed
 The problem occurred when SQuirreL encountered an unknown SQL-Type and decided not to read the data,
 see menu File --> Global Preferences --> tab Data Type Controls --> Section Unknown Data Types

#1310 Mac OS installation does not run
  Separate scripts for Linux/Unix and MACOS were introduced.
  The MACOS script was adjusted according to J√∂rn's suggestions in bug #1310

When file is opened cursor is now positioned at the beginning of the editor.

Fixed missing text resource "Procedures" in Alias schema properties

Fixed error display when connection failed (Resource not found)


3.8.0 (08/29/2017)
==================

Enhancements:

The 'Locale' combo box at menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab General
  now has an entry 'Don't change'. This entry may prevent translation problems
  and will be the default entry for new installations.

The format floating point numbers can now be user defined.
  See menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab 'Data Type Controls --> section 'FLOAT, REAL, ...'

Updated French translation. Thanks to Erwan Duroselle.

The SQL result panel can now be hidden and restore by the new 'Toggle minimize results' function.
  Use ctrl shift M, tools popup or right mouse menu of SQL editor.

#555 New features for code completion needed --> Completion for UDTs
  UDT names are now available in code completion and can be configured in the Alias Properties dialog.
  Note: If you find UDTs are not of use in code completion you can switch it off.
        See menu File --> New Session Properties --> Tab 'Code completion' --> Checkbox at bottom.


The new paste history can be called using ctrl+shift+V oder ctrl+shift+insert. It offers to paste
  the content of former copy or cut actions.

Enhancement of feature request #545: New table right mouse menu 'Copy as markdown table'

The minimum number of decimal digits of floating point numbers can now be defined
  (see menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab 'Data Type Controls --> section 'FLOAT, REAL, ...')
 Thanks to Krzysztof Szymko for the patch.


The limit string loading size option (see menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab 'Data Type Controls --> section 'CHAR, VARCHAR, ...')
  used to work for the Object tree only and now works for SQLs too.
  Furthermore limited strings are now indicated by the ending '...'.
 Thanks to Krzysztof Szymko for the patch.


Table types shown in Object tree can now be filtered, see menu File --> New Session Properties --> tab Object tree --> section Filters

#470 New global preference to auto-save current SQL commands into file at exit and auto-reload them at startup into SQL editor pane.
  See menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab SQL --> Section General --> Check box 'Reload last SQL editor contents when Session is opened'
 Thanks to Krzysztof Szymko for the patch.


The Logs window now remembers its size.


Dataimport Plugin:
 - Improved messaging
 - Table refresh after import
 Thanks to Krzysztof Szymko for the patch.


Bookmarks Plugin: It's now possible to define default values for parameters.
   Here is an extract from updated the SQLBookmark-Plugin help:
     In case you want to give a default value for a parameter the syntax would be ${prompt[, tip](defaultValue)}.<BR>
     Also a list of predefined values is possible. The syntax then is ${prompt[, tip](defaultValue_1|defaultValue_2|defaultValue_3)}
   Thanks to Krzysztof Szymko for the patch.

Comment/uncomment short cuts (ctrl minus / ctrl shift minus) now work with Numpad-minus too.

Added "Create Data Script from SQL", "Store result of SQL in table", "Create Data Script from SQL" functions to editor's right mouse menu.

#491 Tab length can be configured and tabs can be chosen to be replace by spaces.
        See menu File --> New Session Properties --> Tab Syntax

#548 Size of table cell popup can be configured to be saved,
     see menu File --> Global Preferences --> tab General --> last check box in section Appearance

#548 Add button "as XML" to the modal window "Value of column ..." opened from Results table
     AND integrated Json formatting

More Granular RSYNTAX Color Tokens
 Thanks to Duane Redfern for the merge request

Tabs can be closed by middle mouse click

Added default driver definition for Salesforces DB

#545 Copy table excerpts as ascii art for convenient inclusion in text-only docs
   See new entry in table's right mouse menu: Copy aligned (as in 'Results as text' tab)

Added configuration as formulated in bug #1238 (Format SQL puts all columns in SELECT statement in one line)
  See menu "File" --> "Global Preferences" --> tab "SQL formatting" --> "Column list split behavior"

Netezza SYNONYM support added and enhanced‚Ä©
  Thanks to Richard Kooijman for the patch

New high definition icon
  Thanks to Richard Kooijman for the patch


Graph plugin: Added a 'NOT LIKE' operator to Query builder filter.

Bug fixes:

Paste history (ctrl +shift + v or insert): The pasted content didn't move to the top of the history list.

'Toggle minimize results' didn't work for horizontal SQL panel layout. (See menu File --> New Session Properties --> Tab General)

MS Windows: List in 'Paste from History' dialog didn't get focused when opened.


#1262 Error when viewing the content of a table of PostgreSQL database in Object tree.
  The error occurred when a table contained an OID.
 Thanks to Jjarmolowicz for the patch.

#1304 Saving script ruins greek words

Fix the problem with "Show foreign key references..." on a row with
  a raw type (BINARY, VARBINARY, (VAR)CHAR FOR BIT DATA, BLOB) primary-key.
 Thanks to Stefan Mueller for the patch

#1303 Close via session menu does NOT remove session tab

Postgres Plugin: Procedure sources are now shown with signature
  rather than only procedure's body code.
 Thanks to Krzysztof Szymko for the patch.


#1290 Bookmarks plugin: NPE Add empty bookmark --> Empty bookmarks are prevented
#1291 Bookmarks plugin: Add Bookmark dialog looks awfully
#1292 Bookmarks plugin: Edit bookmark is not refreshing User bookmarks tree


When menu File --> Global Preferences --> tab "Data Type Controls" --> "Show newlines as \n within cells"
 was activated newlines where replaced by /n instead of \n
 (mentioned in Bug #1005)

Table export to MS Excel failed when only the selected part of a table was chosen to export.

#1287 On MacOS, the launcher script contains a hard-coded reference to Contents/Resources/Java
  Thanks to Peter G. Horvath for the fix.

Old application icon was shown Unix/Linux OSes.

#618 sqlparam plugin asks for commented variables  is now also fixed for /* */ style comments

#1276 DB Copy Plugin: An error occurred when a table was copied and the table name needed to be double quoted.

Session tabs wheren't selected on mouse click. This bug occurred since the "Tabs can be closed by middle mouse click" feature.

Reconnecting (ctrl alt t) failed on Vertica DB with error:
 java.lang.ClassCastException: net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.gui.SQLCatalogsComboBox$NoCatalogPlaceHolder cannot be cast to java.lang.String
  	at net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.gui.session.CatalogsPanel.getSelectedCatalog(CatalogsPanel.java:184)
  	at net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.gui.session.SessionPanel.getSelectedCatalogFromCatalogsComboBox(SessionPanel.java:513)
  	at net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.session.Session.reconnect(Session.java:561)

#1273 Session, when in detached frame, closes although close is not confirmed.

#1267 NullPointerException on Create Data Script

Postgres plugin:
  Trigger details tab was still using the deprecated condition_timing column in the trigger query,
  causing PSQLException: ERROR: column "condition_timing" does not exist and preventing tab from displaying.
   Thanks to Joseph Dillman for the fix.


#1263 DB copy from MS SQL to HSQLDB with NVARCHAR column leads to no dialect mapping error
   Fixed HSQLDB dialect as suggested in the bug.

3.7.1 (05/08/2016)
==================

Enhancements:

Option to en/disable the "Run all SQLs in editor" function, see menu File --> Global Preferences --> tab SQL

Updated Polish translation. Thanks to Begina Felicysym.

#531 Bookmarks Plugin: In the general options of the bookmarks Plugin (see menu File --> Global Preferences --> tab Bookmarks)
  there is a new option "In ctrl+j popup use "contains" instead of "starts with" to filter entries".

Alias properties --> Tab Schemas --> Table is now sortable
  Thanks to Marek for the patch.

Data import plugin: New option to choose if import is done in a single transaction
                    or if data is committed after every N numbers of inserts, where N can be configured.

Foreign key references window now also produces a result for the root table of the references tree.

Format SQL has three new options, see menu File -> Global Preferences -> Tab SQL formatting
 - Indent sections check box
 - Comma placing radio buttons
 - When AND/OR keywords occur in FROM clauses you can choose to ignore the start new line setting.
   This may be considered to lead to more readable JOIN clauses.

Current SQL mark: In the SQL editor if the caret placed inside an SQL such that this SQL could be executed using ctrl enter, this SQL is now marked by a blue box.
  The feature can be switched off or the color of the box can be changed at menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab "SQL" --> Section "General"

New global preference "In quotes functions should copy quoted SQLs to clipboard", see menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab "SQL" --> Section "General"
  Note: With this change the "Edit Extras"-Plugin was removed. All its functions are now part of SQuirreL's core. The change doesn't effect the
  usage of the functions involved in the change. SQuirreL will not load the "Edit Extras"-Plugin anymore.

Updated Polish translation. Thanks to Begina Felicysym.

Syntax plugin: Last five find strings are now saved and can be selected from the drop down of the find and replace dialog.


Bug fixes:

#963 Stored Procedures are not shown in object tree (reported of Informix DB)

#1245 SQL Script Plugin: Table script creation failed when a column type could not be derived from a Hibernate dialect.
  This problem was probable to occur for user defined types e.g. when domains were used by Postgresql.

Quoting columns didn't work as in other script generation functions when SELECT statements were created (see Object tree's right mouse menu).
  Thanks to Joao Paulo Limberger for the patch.

#1235 Netezza Plugin: Squirrel not showing Netezza (IBM Puredata) synonyms

Fixed bug in "Copy as SQL INSERT-VALUES statement" option: Closing brackets could be lost when timestamp was generated.
  Thanks to Marek for the patch.

#1241 Switching tab using Alt Left/Right doesn't work right after tabs were moved using drag and drop

Improved logging and handling of "Content" tab display in "Objects" tab with the aim of tracking/preventing.
 - If an SQL to load the content tab fails, the complete SQL string ist written to the logs
 - "SELECT *  ..." statement is issued as last fallback.

For the DB2 data types "FOR BIT DATA", GRAPHIC and VARGRAPHIC the "Store result of SQL in table" function did not create the correct "CREATE TABLE" script.
  Thanks to Marek for the patch.


Concerning result output as text:
  Replace null string character (0x00) with SPACE char, as this character cannot be copied to clipboard and data after this null char are not copied.
  (E.g. occurs when working on Win7 with DB2.)
  This fix also replace FF form feed character (0x0C) with SPACE char,
  as FF character is causing problem when text data are pasted into advanced text editor like Ultraedit, it creates unexpected new lines.
  Thanks to Marek for the patch.

Some options in New Session Properties (abort on error, write sql errors to log file) are not saved after Squirrel restart
  Thanks to Marek for the patch.

Milliseconds are lost when you copy timestamp value via "Copy as SQL INSERT-VALUES statement" option
  Thanks to Marek for the patch.

#1240 Data import plugin: When exception occured auto commit mode was usually changed.
  Along with this fix come the following improvements:
  - UI is resizeable
  - Better error messages

#1237 Missing color on SQL window and Object tree window

#1236 Shortcut for comment/uncomment current line (ctrl + "/") does not work
  Fixed according to the suggestion in the bug #1236
  Please note: The orginal comment/uncomment hot key of SQuirreL is ctrl+Numpad minus / ctrl+shift+Numpad minus.

Current SQL Mark was shown in Object tree find field.

#1226 Reconnect didn't work when Session toolbar was configured to be not shown.
  See menu "File" --> "New Session Properties" --> Tab "General" and check the "Show toolbar" check box.


Object tree: Contents tab loading raised ClassCastException when table contents where viewed as text output.

NullPointerException occurred when the "Show foreign key references" right mouse menu item of an SQL result table was clicked.

3.7.0 (09/14/2015)
==================

Enhancements:

Feature request #521 Alias name in SQL History search dialog.

Upgraded to latest RSyntax version (2.5.6).
  The new version has a clipboard history which is accessible through ctrl shift v.
  A little drawback of the new version is that background colors are not supported in syntax styles.


Feature request #485 Execute multiple SQL statements on one click without selection
   The new feature executes all SQLs in the editor.
   If there are multiple SQLs in the editor the statement separator has to be used.
   The feature is accessible through a new tool bar button, tools popup and the alt shift ENTER key combination


Feature request #484 Query output preferences --> Allow table and text output simultaneously
   Note: SQL result output as table or editable table now includes text output in an extra tab.
         That's why there should be only few cases where choosing text output in Session Properties makes sense anymore.

Feature request #479 Add option for tab names to contain only Alias name
   The option can be found at menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab General --> Bottom of section Appearance

Feature request #487 Show AS label as column header (if present)
   If a SQL result contains at least one column whose column name is not equal to its column label a button is shown at the header of the tab named "Result".
   By this button one can toggle display between column names and labels.
   Note: To configure the default display see menu File -> Global Preferences -> Tab Data Type Controls -> Top of panel.


WIKI table Plugin: Added support for JIRA/Confluence Markup Style
  Thanks to Thomas Hackel for the merge request.

Feature request #501 Overview/Charts Tab: Distinct Counts
  - Distinct counts for an Overview as a whole are now displayed right next to the column name
  - Distinct counts of Intervals are available as tool tips
    as well as a new details window which is accessible through the right mouse menu

Sybase dialect support when using jtds
 Thanks to Sumit Agarwal for the merge request.

On Mac OS X the SQuirreL now uses the acorn icon instead of the default java coffee cup icon.
  Thanks to Martin W. Kirst for the merge request.

New command line parameter:
 Short form: -detectEDT
 Long form: --detect-long-running-swing-edt-events
 The parameter has no arguments.
 The parameter enables SQuirreL to detect long running Swing Event Dispatch Thread events.
 When the dispatch thread is blocked for longer than two seconds a warning containing a thread dump is written to the logs.

Upgraded to the latest RSyntax version (2.5.3).

Syntax Plugin: Made background color for white spaces affect the whole SQL editors background, see menu File --> New Session Properties --> tab Syntax
   Note: If you combine this feature with the Metal-Charcoal Look and Feel you can make SQuirreL appear in "fashionable" black.
   Thanks to Duane Redfern for the patch.


When adjusting table column widths a maximum width may now be defined.
  See menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab General --> right column

Speeded up reading and writing Alias properties. As result opening and closing a connections will be much faster for big, complicated databases.
  Thanks to Jaroslaw Jarmolowicz for the patch

Starting and stopping SQuirreL is much faster for big, complicated databases
  Thanks to Jaroslaw Jarmolowicz for the patch

Postgres Plugin:
- For postgres query plans explain was used which is less accurate than explain analyze so it was changed to use it instead.
- Previous implementation had limitation of producing query plans only for SELECT queries. It was changed so query plan can work for every type of query.
- Query plan executions are wrapped in transaction so they don't change database state.
Thanks to Jaroslaw Jarmolowicz for the patch


Bug fixes:

#1185 The example URL for MariaDB is wrong
 Unfortunately the change will only take effect for new installations.

#1191 Remove Newlines Hotkey not working for several versions

#1206 SQuirrel detects single line comment inside string literals

#1210 Empty Contents Tab in SQuirreL when Column-Names contain dashes (except HSQL-DB)

#1212 Selected catalog is not the catalog that is shown in combo box after reconnect.

#1216 PostgreSQL: Content tab doesn't display data when quoting column names is necessary

The overview- and rotated table- tabs broke when more results where read.

DBDiff Plugin: Loading of the DBDiff Object tree menus failed when an Object tree window was opened:
   java.lang.IllegalStateException: ObjectTreeApi can only be provided for SessionInternalFrame or ObjectTreeInternalFrame
   at net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.session.Session.getObjectTreeAPIOfActiveSessionWindow(Session.java:962)

#1161 Sorting Aliases creates duplicate entries in the tree view
   After sorting Aliases in the view without tree, there were duplicate Alias entries in the tree view.
   Note: If your Aliases got duplicated this way you may delete the SQLAliases23_treeStructure.xml file in your SQuirreL user dir.
         This way Aliases will be unique again but tree folder structure gets lost.


#1193 Wrong command for MySQL when renaming a column.
  The problem was a wrong preselection of the dialect for MySql5 DBs.

Hibernate Plugin: In menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab Hibernate --> The "Details..." button in the lower part of the panel used to break with a NullPointerException
  when a directory of the Hibernate class path did not exist.

#1188 Help tree links don't work.

#1183 Empty Contents Tab in SQuirreL when Column-Names contain dashes.
  This was because double quotes were missing around column names

SQuirreL once and again hangs for some seconds on Windows.
  With help of the new detectEDT-feature it was possible to track the problem back to a JDK problem: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6477756
  A workaround is to use the JVM parameter -Dsun.awt.nopixfmt=true. This parameter was introduced to the start batches we ship.
  People who experience the problem and use their own start batches should set the parameter manually.

#1177 Export results to xls fails for large exports that contain DATE columns
  Thanks to Neville Rowe for the fix.

Tool bar of SQL Worksheet was doubled any time it was moved from between different frames.

#1174 PostgreSQL: create table script: wrong data type numeric

#618 SQLParam plugin asks for commented variable.
 Thanks to Michal Stekrt for the patch.


Postgres Plugin:
- Postgres locks table was not displayed.
Thanks to Jaroslaw Jarmolowicz for the patch

Look-and-Feel Plugin: JTattoo-AluminiumLookAndFeel was not available and logged an exception stack trace during start up.

SQuirreL used log an exception stack trace when 'Keep-Alive' was enabled in Alias properties but no SQL statement was entered. Now SQuirreL issues an understandable message.
  This concerns one discussion entry of bug #1162


3.6.0 (10/12/2014)
==================

Enhancements:

Feature request #443 SQL results have new tab "Rotated table" where rows and columns are swapped.

Charts of SQL results: Plain x-y-charts of pairs of numeric columns can now be created.
  Note: Charts make use of JFreeChart: http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/)

New right mouse menu entry in SQL results: "Show foreign key references".
 Select one or more cells of a SQL result then choose the right mouse menu to display the foreign references for the selected cells.
 This function is also available in the right mouse menu of tables in the object tree.

SQL result --> Info tab: SQL is now displayed in text field instead of label. Formatting is preserved.

Check boxes to enable / disable navigation from the SQL editor to the object tree by Ctrl+B and Ctrl + mouse click.

==================

Enhancements:

Hibernate Plugin:
   Improved connection error messaging when creation of a Hibernate SessionFactoryImpl in an external process fails.

Removed misleading button "Remember widths" from Overview Tab

Instead of displaying the file paths in Session tabs a small button is displayed when an open file exists.
  Clicking the button will open a popup menu that gives access to several information and functions concerning the file.

3488629: SQL formatting can be configured. See menu File--> Global Preferences --> Tab SQL formatting

Installer: The DB Copy, DB Diff and Refactoring Plugin have been made standard Plugins.

Graph Plugin: Tables can be selected by rectangle selection like icons on a desktop of modern operating systems.

SQL Execution: The execution panel that is displayed while an SQL statement is being processed is now closeable.
   Before the panel is closed the cancel action gets executed.

Created new Multisource Plugin:
  - Allows SQuirreL to support native multiple source queries where one SQL query spans multiple sources.
  - The plugin supports standard SQL including joins, group by, aggregation, LIMIT, and ordering where tables may come from one or more sources.
  - The plugin will perform function translation where a user requests a function that is not supported on a certain source. 
  - Added a new UnityJDBC default driver definition that supports this virtualization.
  
Graph Plugin: When a child table was removed from a Graph and the the parent tables columns were reordered constraint lines reappeared pointing nowhere.

Syntax Plugin: Upgraded to RSyntax text area version 1.5.2

Add new default driver definitions for HXTT Cobol and XML drivers.

About Dialog:
  Added a tab for displaying the status off all threads.

3463374: Ability to rename SQL Worksheet tabs through Session menu, tab's right mouse menu or shortcut shift F6. (Thanks to Vladislav Vavra for the patch.)

Hibernate Plugin:
 - Support of hql results that return plain values instead of mapped objects. Mixes of plain values mapped objects are supported, too.
 - Support of data changing hql statements.
 - Support for JDBC standard date/time/timestamp escape strings in hql queries. (String are parsed and converted to hql parameters).


DBCopy Plugin:
  - Offers a new menu item "Paste table as ..." that allows to change the pasted table's name.
    This function works if only a single table was copied.
  - Tables can now be pasted to arbitrary Schemas.
  - In the Plugin preferences the user may choose to append copied data to existing tables

Copy as INSERT-VALUES statement now works on almost any table not just on editable tables. If a table isn't in
  a Session scope ";" is used as statement separator instead of the separator defined in Session properties.


Swing Violation Detector Plugin:
  This new plugin will help to detect rule violations of the Swing programming model. The usage of this plugin is only recommonend for
  testers and developers.

Code Completion Plugin:
  The Code Completion Plugin's preferences allows to switch on CamelCase completion
  which is a common feature in many modern IDEs.
  CamelCase completion may be useful if a RDBMS supports capital and small letters in database object names.

Hibernate Plugin:
  - Redesign of HQL result display. Focus is now on displaying result objects instead of Hibernate generated SQL.
  - User can choose if he wants to use the Session's JDBC connection or the one configured with Hibernate.

Syntax Plugin:
  Duplicate line (ctrl+d) now duplicates the line at cursor if no text is selected
  and duplicates the selection if a selection exists.

Hibernate Plugin:
  On Windows the class path's files defined in the Hibernate configuration would remain locked even
  after disconnecting Hibernate. This doesn't happen anymore when Hibernate is run in its own process.

Graph Plugin:
  Tables can be added to a Graph from within the SQL-Editor (accessible from right mouse menu and tools popup).

Graph Plugin:
  Graphs can be copied and pasted.

Graph Plugin:
  New Session toolbar button to create links to Graphs of other JDBC-URLs or to Graphs that are placed arbitrary directories.
  With this feature it is possible to work with shared repositories of Graphs.


Bug fixes:

Fixed layout problem in code completion preference panel.

Applied patch 3100757: squirrel-sql.bat broke if %TEMP% had white space. Thanks to Taneli Waltari for the patch.

Hibernate Plugin: Added missing HQL keyword 'by'. Will now be highlighted and available in HQL code completion.

Graph Plugin --> Query Builder:
  When a table was removed from a query builder graph join types of remaining joins were reset to the default inner join type.

Referesh (F5) didn't work right and didn't delete schema cache files when schema caching was used.

Fixed memory leak: Sessions didn't get garbage collected as soon as a popup (code completion, bookmarks, tools popup) was used.

Connection/Login timeouts (menu File --> Global Preferences --> Tab SQL) as well as canceling the "Connect to" dialog now works cleanly.

When a Session tab is closed that is not the active tab
 the Session menu used to be disabled and keyboard shortcuts didn't work anymore for the active Session.

Graph Plugin: Query Builder: Mixed up ASC and DESC in SQL generation and "order by" panel

Hibernate Plugin: Fixed NullPointer that occurred in HQL execution concerning assisted but nonetheless initialized objects.

2947296 Table script creation for multiple tables fails (on OpenJDK)

Graph Plugin: Opening Link dialog failed on Windows when one or more links already existed.

SQL Editor: Parser mistook minus signs in SQL IN lists as errors.

Error dialog showed up twice when an error occurred during Alias connect.

3026995 Fixed problem in squirrel-sql.bat for 64-bit windows.

Graph Plugin --> Query Builder:
  The "Sync result" button of the "Result" view now refreshes the result even if the SQL statement was not changed.


3.3.0 (11/20/2011)
==================

Enhancements:

Hibernate Plugin:
  Directories containing archive files (Jars, Zips) can now be added to a Hibernate configuration's classpath.
  All files in the directory will be added as classpath entries.

Hibernate Plugin:
  HQL errors during results reading are now displayed as a result tab. (Similar to the new SQL error display.)

Some performance improvements, when searching in the object tree. 
	Now, Squirrel will not try to expand a node twice, if no children were found for a node at a previous search. 

Updated Translations:
 * French (Erwan Duroselle)
 
The make editable function for SQL result tables now preserves the table's layout (ordering, scrolling position, ... ).

New (prettier acorn) icons bundle for MacOS X (Thanks to Travis Hein for arranging the icon bundle and to the 
original photograher - George Georgiades - for releasing the photo under the creative commons license.)

New default SQL driver for LucidDB (Thanks to Brandon Jackson)
	To use the new default driver, it must be imported (Menu Drivers => Install default driver definitions)  

Improved memory management: Now when SQuirreL runs out of memory, it will attempt to close all result tabs, 
in order to free some memory.  This may allow the user to save their preferences/scripts and restart SQuirreL.

SQL Scripts Plugin: Added the capability to "store the execution result of an SQL query into file". This 
  allows the user to store the result of the selected SQL directly into a file, instead of displaying it in 
  a result table. This is avaiable in the tools pop-up (sql2file) and the menu 
  (Session ==> Scripts ==> Store result of SQL in file).
  
  
DBCopy Plugin: (Feature request #3291501) This plugin now has a command-line interface (via DBCopyCLI).  See
               DBCopy plugin documentation for usage details.

Syntax Plugin:
  Ostermiller and Netbeans editors were removed. Users that still used these editors are automatically
  switched to the RSyntax editor.

MSSQL Plugin:
  - Added display of triggers source code.
  - If two views with same name in different schemas exist now the views' source code is
    displayed correctly according to the selected Object tree node.
  Thanks to damluar for the patch (Patch ID: 3310900)


New Plugin: Greenplum DB Plugin
  New Plugin for the Greenplum DB. Thanks to Adam Winn for the patch (Patch ID 3217167)

Feature Request 3438689: (Process SQL Server's NVARCHAR fields).  
	Added dialect mapping support for N* fields in SQL create scripts.

Feature Request 1744964: Copy text from the SQL editor panel as rich text. 
	This functionality is available via the pop-up menu and the tools pop-up. Additionally this mode can be 
	activated for copy shortcuts. 
	See: Session Properties => Syntax => Copy shortcuts use the "Rich Text Format"
	To use this, the RSyntax editor (Syntax Plugin) must be activated.

Source Tabs:
	Syntax highlighting is used for displaying the source of database objects, if the syntax plugin is installed.

Query Builder / New features in Graph plugin:
   The Query Builder is part of the Graph plugin. That means besides the former default and Zoom/Print modes
   Query Builder is a new mode of the Graph Plugin. Any existing Graph can be switched to the new mode.
   Besides the Query Builder itself several new features have been added to the Graph plugin:
   - A Graph can be viewed in separate window.
   - Tables can be dragged from the Object tree to a Graph window. For convenience there is a
     new Session tool bar button that creates a new Graph window and places it right besides the Session's 
     Object tree.
   - Graphs have a Kick off/Start button on the lower left of a Graph panel to give more intuitive access to 
     Graph functions.

Feature Request 3307812: Select an entire row via the table's pop-up menu.

Oracle Plugin: 
   - The DDL of a index could be displayed under the source tab.
   - Display the table related indexes in the object tree under the table node. This is additional to the
     generally index node, which displays all indexes of the schema.
   
New plugin "WIKI table configurations":
  This plugin provides some predefined configurations for various WIKI engines. With these configurations, 
  SQuirreL can transform the selection of a result table into a WIKI table. Currently, configurations for the 
  following WIKI's are provided:
    - Mediawiki
    - TiddlyWiki
  This plugin is a enhancement for the functionality "Copy as WIKI table"

Copy as WIKI table:
  Squirrel is now able, to copy the selection of a result table as WIKI text into the clipboard. 
  (Right click on the result table => Copy as WIKI table) 
  At the new preferences panel "Global Preferences => Wiki Tables", the user can configure individual 
  templates for the WIKI syntax.

Detached result windows now can be rerun.

Feature Request 3185630: SQL Panel layout:
 - Squirrel uses a vertical layout for the SQL Panel. Now, this layout can be changed to horizontal,
   which might be useful on wide screen displays. This can be configured within the 
   Session Properties and New Session Properties => Tab General => Combo Box: SQL Panel layout 
 - A double click on the divider restores the divider position to the default value.
  
Editing numeric values: SQuirreL now has consistent behavior for signed values in all numeric data types. 
  A minus sign is allowed only at the first position and if the data type allows signed values.

Hibernate Plugin: Improved display of mapped objects in table cells:
                  The class name, primary key and toString() are displayed instead of toString() only.

DB-Diff-Plugin:
  Allowed to compare tables within one Session the same way as with different Sessions using select and
  compare of the Object tree's right mouse menu. It is still possible to compare tables inside the
  same Session without using select by marking two tables and just using the compare.

Feature request 3129413: The number of decimal digits are now configurable 
  (See Global Preferences --> 'Data Type Controls')

Feature requests 3001253, 2896494: New icons in Object tree

Display errors in result tab (Feature request 2826179):
  SQL execution errors are now additionally displayed in a temporary result tab.
  - This new feature is enabled by default and can be disabled by navigating 
  	to File --> New Session Properties --> Tab SQL --> Show SQL execution errors in result tab.
  - Along with this feature comes a new Message Panel right mouse menu "Save size 0" that allows
    to hide the Message panel at application start up.

Bug-fixes:

Graph Plugin / Query Builder: Fixed adding Quotes behavior for IN/NOT IN where clause expressions.

3433001: Elapsed time for building output is incorrect.

3183001: ClassCastException occurs, when the first tab should be closed after running a query.

Hibernate Plugin:
 Fixed several bugs in the HQL results reading function concerning lazy loaded non collection attributes.

3408086: Non ASCII characters are highlighted as as invalid characters at the SQL-Editor pane. 

SQLScripts plugin:
  Generating data/insert scripts from inside the Object tree failed for tables that didn't belong to the
  default schema when the Plugins preferences where chosen not to qualify table names.


Patch #3401315 (Derby Object tree trigger).  Trigger source was not being displayed because the  
SYS.SYSTRIGGERS.REFERENCINGOLD and SYS.SYSTRIGGERS.REFERENCINGNEW columns no longer accept 1 and 0 as values 
for comparison.  Now an actual boolean data type is used. (Thanks to Jesus Marin for the patch)

3139446 fixed squirrelsql.bat: % was missing at the end of line set IZPACK_JAVA=%JAVA_HOME

3308469, 3209074, 2983094: SQL with aliases don't result always with aliases as column headings
  Affected modules: 
  - Export as CSV/XLS/XML
  - Copy with headers
  - Copy as HTML

Fixed some memory issues with closed sessions. 

3393589: Introduced performance warning for the global preference " Save Preferences Immediately" when
multiple statements are executed and set the property's default value to false.

2985845: Create table script generates incorrect foreign key stmt: Foreign key columns were used as primary key columns.

If the global setting "General => Save preferences immediately" is enabled, the SQLHistory will be saved immediately after the execution of a statement.  

The column numbers of the header columns are now correct, when exporting the result table as XML.

When displaying the content of a table, the dialog "Please wait while the query is executed" may not dispose.
  This may occurs only for tables of a "In Memory Database" with only a few rows of data. 

When editing table cells in a text area, the input field for the file name will be shown in an appropriate size 
  instead of being very small. If the user change the size of the dialog, the input field for the file name will use the extra space.

Now, "Press to open logs" shows  the current log file by default instead of a random one.

SQL Scripts Plugin: Increased multi table script configuration dialog's size.

Fixed NullPointerException in Hibernate Plugin when executing HQL with 'view objects' switched on.

Hibernate Plugin: Made HQL code completion work more exact.

Hibernate Plugin: Removed unused imports to regain compile independence from Hibernate API changes, see patch ID 3168381

3309565: Not possible to translate SQL connection error messages, because they are hard coded.

3303174: Installer hangs on linux.  Updated version of IzPack compiler to 4.3.4.

3293737: A exception occurs if the value of a SMALLINT column is edited in a result table.

3238037: It's impossible to create a foreign key in oracle 10g, if some tables contains a / in their name eg. recycle bins

3222350: Cannot enter negative values for numeric fields when editing the result table.

3196153: When typing using shift, you must release shift to type space

3175871: On export to Excel, some numeric values are not exported correctly.  

3172465: Error connecting to DB after 3.2.1 upgrade

3171762: Wrong syntax for DROP KEY (When qualify table name preference is selected this produced two schema
         or catalog prefixes on the table name)

3148653: Missing App Icon on Mac OS X (Fix is available in the Mac OS X 3.2.1 installer file)

3137852: DB2 Plugin - The source code is not visible, if a char column contains a default value.

3088572: Squirrel fails when user tries to edit DB fields which have particular characters.

3.2.0 (11/21/2010)
==================

Enhancements:

Updated Translations:
 - Chinese (Thanks to xpdz)
 - French  (Thanks to Erwan DUROSELLE)
 
SQL Scripts Plugin:
  New preference that allows to choose the escape string for new lines. See Global Preferences --> Tab SQL Scripts
  (See patch #3079664 by Paul Wagland)

Hibernate Plugin:
  - New handling of limiting object count for HQL queries. This may prevent severe performance problems.
    Formerly the limit was set more or less under the hood (SQL limit was used).
    Setting the limit can cause the performance problems.  
  - Hibernate session can now be started in an external process.
    This can keep SQuirreL from running into memory problems when working with the Hibernate Plugin.
    See Hibernate configuration panel for details. 

Introduced a new general data type property 'Use column labels instead of column names in result headers'.
See Global Preferences --> Tab 'Data Type Controls'. Will be useful e.g. for MySQL if Aliases are used in Select clauses.

Session Property: "Keep SQL result table layout on rerun SQL"
If this option is checked the layout of the table of a SQL result is tried to be restored after rerunning the SQL.
Note: You rerun an SQL statement when you click the running man button on the upper left of a SQL result.

New way to view query results: There is a new tab inside a query result named "Overview".
It might need some trying out to understand what it does.  

Incorporated patch which provides a node in the object tree called LOB which lists all LOBs, providing 
details about each (Thanks to Bogdan Cristian Paulon) 

Incorporated patch which provides a node under each table in the object tree that lists all of the 
constraints for that table. (Thanks to Bogdan Cristian Paulon)

Netezza Plugin: Added support for displaying external tables in the object tree.

SQuirreL SQL Client is now built, tested and released with Maven.

Bug-fixes:

2693968: The "Load columns in background" setting (session properties -> SQL tab) is lost through restarts.

3085119: NullPointerException when adding tables to graph.

3088284: CSV export doesn't escape quotes. Thanks to wolfgang22 for the patch.
3086444: Date/Time/Timestamp types did not display right after application restart when others than standard
  formats were chosen in Global Prefs. (See patch 3087989)
2998121: (Update doesn't work, settings seem correct).  Now, if the local release.xml file 
         is not found the error dialog states as the cause, rather than merely saying the release.xml file 
         couldn't be downloaded.
2991971: RSyntax text editor ignores font settings
2992443: Cannot use RSyntax or Netbeans editors
2973045: Export to excel results in strange rounding; Thanks to Bogdan Cristian Paulon for the patch 
1808038: Splash screen was always on top hiding all other windows behind it

Popup-Menu for adding or removing driver specific properties didn't appear in driver properties
 tab of alias properties on Win XP. (See patch 3083166)

Double click in Alias tree always opened the selected Alias even if the mouse pointer wasn't placed on the Alias.
 This way Aliases where opened when tree nodes where quickly closed or opened.

RSyntax editor: Replace dialog: Replace button now does a find next after replacing. 

Fixed problem with sorting after dragging columns

Button sizes differed in Alias and Driver docking frame  

Hibernate plugin: Icon buttons for connecting and opening configuration could be very small.

Firebird Manger Plugin: Removed dialog (that pointed out missing Firebird driver) from startup routines.

Fixed Alias Properties not showing when drivers getPropertyInfo() fails. Behavior has been seen with Oracle driver.

RSyntax: Turned off drag and drop inside the editor. It conflicted with our
drag and drop feature for files and caused editor texts to vanish. See bug #3006515. 

RSyntax: When code reformatting was used on Windows, carriage return chars (\r) where inserted in the editor.
These chars made keyboard arrow keys fail: If you stepped over an \r the key hit did nothing.

Parser could be triggered far to often which resulted in high CPU and memory load.
This problem was caused by redundant carriage return chars (\r).

Any redundant carriage return chars (\r) are removed from files.
On Win Platforms carriage return line feeds (\r\n) are kept for new lines.

3.1.1 (4/24/2010)
================

Enhancements:

Code completion Plugin:

2991709: Quotes missing in squirrel-sql.bat
2990527: nChar() is unknown field
2982594 / 2988387: RSyntax editor crash
When database errors occurred while loading table columns, SQuirreL slowed down and produced a lot of log messages.
2981691 / 2981694: squirrel-sql.bat fails on Windows 7 64 bit
2980873: squirrel-sql.bat doesn't work out of box
2978540: Identifiers starting with '_' where not handled as identifiers by the RSyntax lexer. This resulted in syntax coloring and completion problems. 
2974533: Informix: Method can be called only once. / ErrorCode: -79
2965617: Fail to open session with RSyntax editor
2963371: Splash on 3.1 - copyright (was not updated for 2010)

See Help for screenshots and more details.

Aliases now have the ability to setup a keep-alive SQL statement and sleep time (in seconds) to prevent a 
connection from being disconnected while appearing to be idle.  This is done using the new Connection tab 
on the Alias properties dialog.

Derby Plugin:
 New tab to display the source code of Derby stored procedures 
 Thanks to Glenn (bassnfool2) for the patch (Patch ID 2907220)

      escape: Unmark all.
  - Line numbers can be displayed
  - Current line can be highlighted
  Note: On MS-Windows systems the Java-VM parameter -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true must be set in your SQUirreL 
        start batch to prevent performance problems. 


 - New Polish translation available (Thanks to Miron Sadziak)

Better table header rendering for MAC OS
  Thanks for Brian Mauter's Patch (ID 2856103)

Feature request 2826175:

   * Rename (on table nodes)

SQL Scripts Plugin:
 New checkbox 'Use double quotes (") for qualifying' in global scripting preferences. 

Feature Request #2818444:  Oracle: Connecting as SYS not possible - now it is possible to add the necessary 
driver property to connect as SYS, or any other account that needs to connect as SYSDBA.

Look & Feel Plugin
 - Better support for Nimbus: No horizontal scrollbars on pop up lists (e.g. code completion) 
 - Removed choices for Metouia and OYOAHA as these are not supported for use in Java 6.

Oracle Plugin
 - SQL*Loader control file generation.
   Adds a new right mouse menu item to tables in the object tree: "Generate SQL*Loader control file"
   Thanks to Jos√© David Moreno Ju√°rez for the patch (Patch ID 2776344)

About dialog now has a clickable link to our home page.
 - Thanks to Hashim Kubba for this patch (ID 2104309)

Graph Plugin:
 - Show constraint name can be selected on each constraint separately. See right mouse menu on constraint 
   line.
 - Allowed constraints to be created using drag and drop.
   To create such a non-DB constraint using drag and drop hold
   down the control key. Then right click the constraint to configure it.  


Bug-Fixes:

SQuirreL was seen consuming a lot of memory and CPU.
 For details about the fix see comments in class ExitParserThreadRequestException
 See: http://squirrel-sql.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrel-sql/sql12/app/src/net/sourceforge/squirrel_sql/client/session/parser/kernel/ExitParserThreadRequestException.java?view=log

Loading and saving files on Windows produced multiple CR (carriage return) chars in files.
When copy and paste was used on such files multiple empty lines were created.
Note: The Windows standard editor Notepad shows multiple CR chars where they exist and allows to remove them.
      SQuirreL does not remove them automatically at any place.

Moved focus to SQL Editor when it gets visible through previous Session / next Session navigation (Alt left/right)

Fixed class not found exception in Oracle Plugin when setting Session Time Zone.
Thanks to Neville Rowe

ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception occurred when more than one Alias was deleted form Alias tree  

Fixed startup error:
 java.lang.NullPointerException
 at ... .AliasFolderState.applyExpansionAndSelectionToNode(AliasFolderState.java:144)

Error in Alias tree: Alias vanished or gave an error when dragged on itself.

SQL Scripts Plugin:
 - Several scripting functions did not respect global scripting preferences about qualifying tables.
 - When generating insert scripts from a SQL statement the global
   preference "Qualify table names in generated scripts with the schema name" did not work.
   Thanks to Johann Geyer for the patch (Patch ID 2365193)
 - Generating data scripts may throw java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when timestamps where scripted
 - Foreign key constraints with more than one column were not scripted correctly. (Only first column was 
   included.)  

Schema caching:
 Removed problems with selective schema caching when the same table name
 exisits in two different schemas. E.g. column completion didn't word anymore.

Stored Procedures that return a mix of update counts and results sets weren't displayed properly.


3.0.1 (3/23/2009)
================

Enhancements:

 - New Korean translation available (Thanks to Youngwoo Kim)

   installer. 

 - NullPointerException occurred when last tab was closed

 - Fixed several problems when Schemas where cached. For example, "Contents Tab SQL filter" and 
   "Limit cell edit WHERE clause size" dialogs did not open.

 - Fixed a problem where when certain windows were closed (for example, the Session Properties window) the 
   first tab was always selected

3.0 (2/21/2009)
==============

Enhancements: 

Dataimport Plugin:
  * SuggestColumns: if columns in database and in the first line of the file
    are equal, they are matched for the import.

Sybase Plugin:
  * New ExceptionFormatter for SQLWarnings: better viewing warnings while the parameter
    showplan is on (set showplan on) 

Look an Feel Plugin:

Updated Italian translation (Ivo Neri), Chinese translation (xpdz), French translation (Erwan Duroselle)

New user interface layout: Tabbed layout

Hibernate Plugin:
   - Cleaned up details display in mapped objects tab: Now every tree node displays an appropriate details table.
   - Added hint to solve StackOverflowError caused by logging that may occur when connecting to a Hibernate configuration.

Object tree search (Feature request 2004240):
   Above the Object tree is a text field and a find button.
   The search string has to be the exact simple (unqualified) name of an DB object or may contain placeholders ("%" or "_").
   The text field supports code completion.
   A filter button allows to apply the search string as Object tree filter. 

Object tree filtering:
   Multiple (comma separated) Object tree filters can be defined. Filter conditions can be excluding oder including.
   Better support for placeholders "%" and "_".
   See "Session Properties"/"New Session Properties" dialogs --> Tab "Object Tree".

Graph Plugin:
 - Qualified table names can now be displayed. Use the right mouse menu on graph background.

Edit Extras Plugin:
 - Improved handling and look of Escape date dialog. 

Graph Plugin:
 - New entries in table's popup menu: "Copy table name" and "Copy qualified table name".
 - Columns of all tables in a graph can now be ordered at once. Use the right mouse menu on graph background.

New Plugin: Smarttools by Michael Romankiewicz
  - Searching for tables that do not have a primary key or unique index or index.
  - Searching for non nullable columns that contain null values. Some DBs e.g. Firebird can be tricked to have this inconsistency.
  - Changing values database wide according to specified criteria.
  For more information see the Plugin's help.


New Plugin: Firebird Manager by Michael Romankiewicz
  - Storing and restoring Firebird DBs
  - Managing users and roles for the Firebird RDBMS
  For more information see the Plugin's help.

 - Aliases can be displayed as list or as tree.

 - A new preference for choosing Locales is available in Global Preferences -> General tab.  This allows you to
   set your preferred locale, and if an optional translation is installed that corresponds with the preferred
   locale, then restart and the changes take effect.(No longer necessary to hand edit the start script)

 - Copy as "SQL WHERE" / "UPDATE-SET" / "INSERT-VALUES" statement function in tables
   Tables offer right mouse menu to copy WHERE, UPDATE-SET or INSERT-VALUES clauses of selected data to clip board.
   Works like the existing "Copy as SQL IN statement" function.

 - New Plugin: SQLReplace by Dieter Engelhardt
   This plugin replaces a set of variables before a statement is executed.
   The variables to replace can be defined at the Plugin's Global Preferences tab.  

 - Added a preference option to allow the selection of items in lists to change while activating
   the popup menu on a single right-mouse button click.  For example, without this, you need to 
   select an object in the tree with a left mouse button click, then press the right mouse button 
   to activate the popup menu.(See Global Preferences -> General -> Select On Right Mouse Click)

Data Import Plugin: It now warns the user when importing data into an existing table, that it's current data 
                    will be truncated first.

DBCopy Plugin: 
 - Added support for mapping the DISTINCT source column type for copying data from PostgreSQL

DB2 Plugin: Lars Heller provided a patch to add support for XML column types in SQuirreL via the 
            DB2 Plugin (tested against DB2 v9.5 LUW)

Oracle Plugin:
 - Added validity (VALID|INVALID) field to trigger details tab for triggers.
 - Allow the user to configure whether or not to show the syntax error offset in 
   the SQL Editor.  This feature creates a user-defined function called 
   SQUIRREL_GET_ERROR_OFFSET, which can be disabled.
 - Added ability to recognize "create package" and "create package body" statements.   

PostgreSQL Plugin:
 - Added support for PostgreSQL(8.3.x) new XML type.

 Contributions from Daniel Regli and Yannick Winiger:
 - Menu: added a new "PostgreSQL" menu to the object tree and the session menu for
   PostgreSQL-specific functionalities.
 - Vacuum: added visual (dialog) support for the PostgreSQL-specific VACUUM statement for
   garbage-collecting a selection of tables or the whole database.
 - Explain: added an additional SQLResultExecuter to the sql panel that shows
   the query plan of executed statements.

Refactoring Plugin:
 - Fixed bug which caused column comment alter statement to be generated even when no column column 
   change was made.

 - Don't try to order the list of tables to be dropped (forcing FK info retrieval) 
   when there is only one table being dropped.

 - Contributions from Daniel Regli and Yannick Winiger:
   Added new Refactorings (All new refactoring dialogs can now be closed with the ESCAPE key):
    - Rename Table
    - Add/Rename/Drop View

   Made Refactoring and scripting functions available for the Intersystems Cache DB by activating its 
   Hibernate dialect.

Bug-Fixes:

SQL Replace Plugin: Fixed a bug that caused patterns such as $P{startDate} to throw an exception.

Add/Edit Alias window did not resize properly

SQL Scripts Plugin: On some DBs (e.g. MySQL) "Store result of SQL in table"
                    did not work for SQLs that returned a lot of rows.   


Graph Plugin: Table's right mouse menu "Add Parent tables" did add a parent more
              than once when more than one foreign key to the parent existed.    

Graph Plugin: Refresh didn't work for newly created constraints

Fixed several bugs which made it impossible to work with SQLite.

Fixed a bug which made it difficult to see text that was being edited in a table.

2609090: Auto update fails if "empty" change list is validated

2480365: Plugin loading fails when installdir has spaces

2220792: SQLite: content not editable

2184379: (SQuirrel client 2.6.6 fills up 52 gigs of log file space).  Added a new log 
appender that is based on file size rather than time.

2119937: Windows EOL chars (CRLF) are converted to Linux EOL (LF).

2104422: Fixed some potential bugs (Thanks to Hashim Kubba)

2102894: Missing Scale Placeholder in Sql server dialect.  This causes script generation and dbcopy 
targeting MS-SQL server to produce decimal columns without the scale attribute (that is, decimal(7) instead 
of decimal(7,5))

2092902: Focus remains on hidden session window for Alt-Arrow.  Removed code which was a 
work-around for a bug in java 1.3, that has since been fixed and was actually producing a 
bug seen in java5 and java6, where the Alt-RightArrow key shortcut switched session windows 
into the foreground without giving them focus.  Thanks goes to Johnathan James for the 
bug-fix.

2091569: FAQ is missing its images

2049336: Make Editable disappear from SQL/results tab

2018512: DB2 timestamps still don't work when milliseconds are zero. Patch submitted by Daniel Str√§nger.

2018018: (Bug in FormatSql function) Formatter now uses platform-specific EOL char sequence.  

2013346: export csv with option "carriage return + linefeed"

1995728: Unable to switch database

1958881: (Unable to see source of database views)  Adjusted the query for view source to use 
underlying system tables instead of INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS, since this view cannot handle views 
that are greater than 4000 characters.

1968807: Unsigned INT problem with IMPORT FILE functionality

1968270: Displaying unsigned INT as signed INT in column

1845987: PostgreSQL interval types are not displayed

1840266: Create Table Script sets varchar columns to 8000

1830649: Focus Loss

1824534: Constraint created twice

1902611: (Oracle) Don't fail on SQL-Plus "SET ..." commands in SQL script; Now, the Oracle plugin skips over 
                  them. 

1876352: (DB2) Incorrect  TIMESTAMP in create data script (loss of precision - nanosecond component - also
               affected other databases.

1861402: (Informix catalog switching doesn't work correctly) 
 - Better catalog switching behavior for databases that support catalogs.  Now if a connection is made 
   without specifying the catalog, a place-holder
   catalog ("None") is inserted into the catalog drop-down menu and removed once a catalog is selected.  
 - Fixed a race condition that caused the tree to be refreshed before data was refreshed from the database 
   when the catalog was switched.  
 - For Informix, setCatalog seems to have no effect, so now an explicit DATABASE <catalog name> command is 
   issued. 

1848924: Sybase object browser contents not displayed

1769599: fix for permission problem with Windows Vista.  Now we create our temporary path file in a temporary 
location that the user should always be able to write to.  Thanks to user aberdeen61 for contributing the 
fix. 

1596240: Fixed bug when displaying HSQLDB->Objects->Content, where contents are not shown and exceptions are 
thrown because tables are not being qualified with the schema name.

1541325: (Derby) Connection doesn't close when ending session - thanks goes to Alex Pivovarov for the 
                 patch that fixed the issue. 

Bug-Fix for bug that caused Frontbase indexes not to be displayed in the indexes tab, for tables in the 
Object tree.

Fixed identifier qualification in Progress - tested on OpenEdge 10.1C.  Now only schema is pre-fixed to 
identifiers, instead of catalog and schema.

Code Completion Plugin:
 - Made column completion available for databases/JDBC drivers that support catalogs and/or schemas
   but don't provide catalog or schemas in their column meta data. For example some versions of MySQL
   show this behavior.

DBCopy Plugin:
 - Only attempt to order the tables being copied if there is more than one table in the copy set.

Changing to another window using Alt + left/right arrow did not properly set focus.

Hibernate Plugin: 
 - Class names in completion list could change from fully qualified to simple
   while scrolling through the completion list.
 - Fixed identifier qualification in Progress - tested on OpenEdge 10.1C.  
   Now only schema is pre-fixed to identifiers, instead of catalog and schema.
   When a statement like "from Kv k where k." was completed the fields for k. would come from 
   any arbitrary mapped class which name started with Kv

Refactoring Plugin: When generating DROP TABLE statements, Frontbase requires
CASCADE or RESTRICT.  Now we append CASCADE to the DROP TABLE statement.

1830649: Focus Loss
1820792: Sybase ASE - table not shown in object browser
1821354: Changing default value of a column in Derby does nothing
1820214: 2.5.1 DB aliases do not transfer properly to 2.6.1
1820020: modified tables aren't sorted
1815667: Create Table Script does not include column defaults

Syntax Plugin: Fixed memory leak which caused sessions not to be garbage 
collected.

Bug-fix for plugin unloading where unloading a session plugin did not prevent 
it from binding to new sessions.

2.6.1 (10/24/2007)
==============

Bug-Fixes:

1818446: Packaging problem in v2.6 on MacOS X
1805954: Tables not in alpha order in Object view

2.6 (10/20/2007)
==============

Enhancements:

New Plugin (Hibernate)
   - allows to generate SQL statements from Hibernate HQL statements
   - shows object tree of mapped objects
   - HQL Code completion and syntax highlighting
   - Three ways to create a HibernateSessionFactory
     * Native way using "new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();"
     * JPA way using "Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("<persitence-unit name>");"
     * User defined way to by calling a user defined provider method.
   See help for further details.

Improved speed at which large files are loaded into import popup for 
CLOB/VARCHAR cells.

Added basic drag-n-drop to transfer a file from the desktop into an SQL Editor 
panel.

   the copy operation was complete. 

DB2 Plugin: 
 - Added tab for displaying the source code for DB2 MQTs as well as DB2 
   tables.
 - Added support for OS/400 (trigger source and details not yet implemented). 
   Special thanks goes to Tilmann Brenk for submitting OS/400 versions of all SQL 
   statements required to support the plugin features.
 - Added support for showing user-defined functions in the object tree and the 
   source code that is associated with them if it is available.
 - Exceptions from DB2 Universal JDBC driver are now interpreted as 
   DB2Diagnoseable exceptions so that the cause of the exception can be printed 
   (Thanks to Christoph Schmitz).
 - When the source tab of a C-language stored procedure is selected, we now 
   show the user a nice informative message stating that the source code is 
   unavailable instead of merely displaying the word "null".

Code Completion Plugin:
  When Ctrl+Space is hit while completion popup is already open the prefix up to
  where all completion candidates match will be written to the SQL editor. The 
  completion popup will remain open.
		   
Derby Plugin: New custom QueryTokenizer which allows Derby sessions to give the 
              command:  run '<abs-path-to-script>'
              This reads in the file and executes it's statements.  This is

   the cursor is moved to the position of the incorrect syntax.

LAF Plugin: Added Substance 4.0 look and feel as an option.

MySQL Plugin: 
 - Added support for handling stored procedure create statements.
 - Added source tab for Stored Procedures, Triggers and Views.  Triggers are 
   displayed as object nodes beneath tables as is done in other plugins.

Oracle Plugin: 
 - 1446678 (SQL Error Help) Added capability to put the cursor at the position 
   in the SQL where the statement failed.
 - 890843, 1787653: Added support Oracle's SYS.XMLTYPE column.
 - Warning message is displayed if string literal timestamp setting is used for
   internal where clauses - this setting may result in the inability to edit 
   tables.
 - (Feature Request 1735530: Hide Oracle Bin$.....==$0 tables ) 
 	Added configuration for removing the Recycle Bin tables from the object tree.
 - Show the source for Oracle tables, as well as materialized views.  
 - Added additional query tokenization pass to find begin...end;/ type 
   anonymous procedures.
   
PostgreSQL Plugin:
 - Added database locks display tab for PostgreSQL sessions.  Click on the top 
 node in the object tree and look for a "Locks" tab.  Code was adapted from Rocco
 Rutte's tab of the same name and purpose in the EclipseSQL project.

Refactoring Plugin: 

 - Fixed problem where the comment of a column could not be altered if it was 
   null.
 - Refactored drop tables command to not use the event dispatch
thread for calculating foreign keys(UI Responsiveness).  Also, now FKs in child 
tables are dropped before any parent tables are dropped when cascade 
constraints is selected.

SQLScripts Plugin: Now uses types generated by Hibernate dialects for create
table script feature.  Also, it now uses the session query tokenizer.  

Sybase Plugin: Added new trigger and index nodes beneath tables in the tree.  
Also, added trigger source tab for triggers.

Patch 1761706 (Miscellaneous Java 5 Generics) submitted by Bron Eubanks

Task 138098 (Plugins Session Menu Items (Disable)) When using a session that 
  is not supported by a db-specific plugin, that plugin should disable it's 
  Session menu items

Task 137959 (Refactor PreferencesManager) removed redundant plugin class 
  definitions related to Preferences which were very similar.

- Added unload button to plugin summary dialog which will cause the selected 
  plugin to be unloaded.
  
- Added support for setting whether or not plugins are loaded at startup 
  (without physically removing them), using the plugin summary dialog.  You must 
  restart SQuirreL for plugin change to take effect.
  
- Added 'Use PK' button on the "Edit Where clause" dialog which will cause only
  PK columns to be used for updating rows in the table contents panel.
- Added "All Objects" to alias properties.
- Use the last directory that a file was imported from when importing 
  additional files for binary fields.
  
1757076: (DATE column seen as TIMESTAMP, update in editable mode fails) Changed
the default of "Read Date as Timestamp" to false.  This setting breaks editing
dates on Derby.

1743720: (Save settings immediately, not only when closing SQuirreL).  Now there
is a setting in Global Preferences to "Save Preferences Immediately" (Default 
is true) Additionally, if this is not desired and it can be disabled to give the 
old behavior (faster), and a new menu item under "File" called "Save Preferences" 
is available to immediately save everything that is normally saved during 
shutdown.

1742033: (Skipping quoting escape in table dropping) Refactoring plugin drop 
table functionality now handles tables with embedded double quotes by doubling 
the double quotes to allow the database to recognize the doubled quote as a 
single quote which is part of the identifier. Thanks goes to Thomas Mueller 
(from www.h2database.com) for contributing code to fix the issue)

1731251: (Cryptic exceptions with DB2 JCC driver) Provides an API to allow 
plugin authors to create and register custom exception formatters to be used 
when displaying error messages and the like in the session message panel.

Updated French translation (Thanks to Erwan Duroselle)
Finished German translation

Bug-Fixes:

Statements like
"SELECT TestTab.testid, TestTab.testname FROM TestTab"
were not editable.

Fixed bug in CodeReformator which is exposed when the statement separator 
is "|".  Also, made formatted source tab able to handle this type of problem 
more gracefully by showing the source in it's original form, instead of 
nothing at all.

Goto line dialog (ctrl+g) was missing labels.

1752089 (ConcurrentModificationException raised when loading schema)

1716859 Can't see data in content tab or row count tab (MS SQLServer databases
        with a dash ("-") in their name would cause the content tab or row count
        tabs to render no data.

1714476 (DB copy uses wrong case for table names) The copy operation would
         sometimes fail to select records from the source table.  Since the
         case for the source table is always known to be correct, the plugin
         no longer erroneously attempts to correct the case.

1714475: (Adding rows from the content tab)  When inserting row data, pay 
         attention to isAutoIncrement flag so that these columns are excluded 
         like rowId columns.  After insert, refresh the table data so that 
         auto-generated fields are populated.

1704798 ISQLExecutionListeners cannot return "null"

1701380 addSQLExecutionListener is broken

1700093 Formatter fails for insert script with multiple sub-selects

1699294 Squirrel imports BLOB, but does not update data 

138092 (PostgreSQL table types) Now PostgreSQL table types list and object tree
       exclude "SYSTEM INDEX" type.  Treating these objects as tables causes 
       lots of SQLExceptions from the PostgreSQL jdbc driver.

Refactoring Plugin:
 - When building a new TableColumnInfo, if the defaultValue textfield is blank, 
   then make the default value be null.

Task 137984 (Bug in alias delete) The problem was that notifications were 
  being sent to the alias drop-down that the item was being deleted which 
  triggered an update and new selection forcing the connect to alias window to 
  be launched.  Now, the alias drop down is disabled while the update is 
  happening and enabled immediately afterward.

Fixed a bug that occurred when no plugin installs a custom QueryTokenizer in 
a Session - changing the session properties for query tokenizing has no 
effect.

Fixed bug which appeared while editing tables in PostgreSQL 8.1.  If the table 
was created without an OID column, the last column would not be editable.

Fix for issue where dates aren't correctly displayed or updated when using 
'treat date as timestamp' pref in the SQl Editor result panel.

2.5 (4/7/2007)
==============

Enhancements:

- Updated Czech translation (Thanks to Jan Kostrhun)
- Updated Simplified Chinese translation (Thanks to xpdz)
- Updated French translation (Thanks to Erwan Duroselle)
- Updated Italian translation strings (Thanks to Ivo Neri)

- When the user control-clicks on an identifier in the SQL editor it takes you 
  will show that object in the object tree (Same behavior as Ctrl-b).

- Dialog prompt to save file changes on exit, now includes the filename in 
  case there are multiple open files in different sessions.  Also, the session
  alias name appears in the title, in case the editor contents aren't yet 
  associated with a file.

- SQL history window
  The contents of the SQL history combo box can now be opened in a window
  where the user can search for formerly excuted statements. The history
  is available through a button next to the SQL history combo box or through
  tools pop up (ctrl+t).

- Export: Warn the user when exporting data to CSV/Excel if there are Clob 
  placeholders (<Clob>) in the table data being exported.  Also, let the user 
  know when the export to file is complete, if no command is to be executed to 
  show the exported file.
  
- 'Delete Records' action now orders the selected tables in order to satisfy any
  FK dependencies.  Previously, this operation would fail if PK tables preceded
  (by name alphabetically) FK tables in the object tree list.

- Certain plugins (Oracle, Sybase, MS SQL-Server) now have configuration tabs 
  (in Global Preferences) to allow for configuration of the statement separator 
  for scripts independently from the Session properties configuration.  For 
  example, this means that now when you switch between session windows that use 
  different statement separators (Oracle = ';' / Sybase = 'GO'), you no longer 
  have to change the global statement separator for all sessions to get the 
  correct one for script execution. As long as you have the plugin installed 
  which corresponds to the type of database that a session is accessing, a 
  reasonable default is supplied to make this configuration unnecessary in most 
  cases.

- Added better support for executing large scripts (by default, a script is 
  considered large if it has > 200 SQL statements selected for execution in the
  script).  Now, only one message is written in the message panel at the bottom
  of the session window at the end of running many statements summarizing the 
  details of execution (timing, statement type and count, etc).  The message
  "SQL Statement x of y <some sql...>" is still displayed in the results panel to 
  indicate progress. Also, the history bar isn't updated during large script 
  execution. The "200 SQL statement" default is configurable in Global 
  Preferences under 'SQL' tab and all of this new functionality can be disabled 
  by using '0' (zero) as the value of large script statement count.  This 
  dramatically improves UI responsiveness for large scripts (especially those 
  with statement counts in the thousands) and makes it possible to cancel the 
  execution using the cancel button - which is otherwise effectively disabled 
  while the UI attempts to keep up with all of the UI updates in a large script.

New Plugins for H2, PostgreSQL and DB2
	These plugins provide source tabs for stored procedures, views and triggers.
	They also provide details tab for sequences and triggers	

New Plugin for Sybase ASE by Ken McCullough
  	The plugin allows to script the code of Views and Stored Procedures of the 
  	Sybase ASE DB.

Code Completion:
   - The number of table columns that should be displayed on top of the 
     completion list when completion is called outside of the scope of a 
     table/view is now configurable in code completion properties.

Edit Extras:
   - New formatting action - remove newlines.  This is useful when copying SQL 
     from console windows that insert end-of-line characters when copying.

Refactoring Plugin
  - Added support for modifying the column type from varchar2 -> clob and 
    clob -> varchar2 (which isn't directly supported by Oracle's column modify 
    alter statement).
  - 'Drop Tables' action now orders the selected tables in order to satisfy any
    FK dependencies.  Previously, this operation would fail if PK tables 
    preceded (by name alphabetically) FK tables in the object tree list.
    
SQL Scripts Plugin
  - Now when selecting 'Create Data Script', the insert statements created are
    ordered by the first column.

Oracle Plugin
  - Added configuration panel for Oracle plugin in Global Preferences to allow 
    configuration of new custom Oracle query tokenizer.
  - Added support for executing create procedure, create function and create
    trigger blocks delimited by a single "/" such as is supported in SQL-Plus.  
    Also, added support for the "@" construct which is used to specify a script 
    file to be executed without loading it into the SQL Editor first.
  - Source tab for views now presents source code that is formatted and 
    correctly formed to allow it to be used as an SQL statement to replicate 
    the view.
  - Added the schema name to the SID for session nodes - it's easier now to 
    find the session you are looking for.

Informix Plugin
  - Is now using the code reformatter for formatting the Source Tab for views 
    The code reformatter was written by Gerd Wagner and previoously located in 
    the EditExtras plugin.  It has been moved to core so that other plugins can 
    take advantage of this capability.

DBCopy Plugin 
  - Allow the user to set "0" for the fetch size to indicate that this should 
    not be called.  JDBC-ODBC bridge driver fails to execute *any* SQL once you 
    have set the fetch size to *any* value.
  - Analyzes FKs to be copied and skips them if they already exist in 
    destination database. 
  - Now the plugin reorders source tables to satisfy FK dependencies when 
    copying data into existing tables with similar constraints.
  - The error message for SQLExceptions now includes the SQL statement that was 
    last executed (including bind variable values if it was a PreparedStatement)

Data Type Controls/DBCopy preference sheet scrolling - sped up the scrollbar 
so that one click of the down arrow gives ~10 pixels of scroll instead of 
only 1 pixel.  This makes it so that scrolling with a wheel mouse moves from 
top edge to bottom edge in about three full rotations of the wheel instead of 
about thirty.

Bug-Fixes:
- Fixed issue where USERS, SESSIONS, INSTANCES nodes in the object tree for 
  Oracle sessions weren't being populated with child nodes when the session is 
  first started.
- Added support for identifying Informix XPS, so that the Informix plugin can 
  be used (Thanks to Dieter Engelhardt for the patch)
- When treating dates like timestamps, simply use the DataTypeTimestamp class 
  instead of trying to make the DataTypeDate class smart enough to interpret 
  timestamps.  This fixes the issue where a Number format error was encountered
  while editing DATEs when they are being interpreted as TIMESTAMPS.
- Fixed NPE that is seen on startup when sessions are set to "Connect at Startup"
- Fixed functions like Quote/Unquote SQL or Format SQL which were removing new lines.
  (Now there is a separate function to remove newlines)
- Caching of schemas (serializing to disc) failed. A NotSerializableException 
  was thrown, due to development code introduced during version 2.5 development.
- An error occurred when F5 (Refresh) was hit in a SQL Work Sheet or an Object Tree Window.

1689040 (plugins prefs files saving) 
	Now preferences for some plugins (DBCopy, MS SQL-Server, Oracle, SQLScript and 
	Sybase ASE)  that were formerly stored in the program plugin directory, are now 
	stored in the user's settings directory.  This means that preferences for these 
	plugins should now be preserved when re-installing SQuirreL to a new location.  
	To migrate existing settings, command-line arguments can be given: 
	
	-DmigratePreferences=true -DoldSQuirreLInstallDir=<old location>
	
	This will result in migrating newer prefs.xml files that are located in
	the program plugin directory 
	
	(e.g. <old location>/plugins/dbcopy/prefs.xml) 
	
	to the user's settings directory 
	
	(e.g. USER_HOME/.squirrel-sql/plugins/dbcopy/prefs.xml)
	
	You should edit the launch script to add these settings, start SQuirreL, 
	stop SQuirreL gracefully, then remove these settings from the launch script.

1682289 Schema browser won't show all schemas. 
	    (Thanks to Robert Williams for the patch)

1681202 Access to column metadata by name (that is, COLUMN_NAME) fails. This 
        affected the SQLScripts and Graph Plugins for some versions of the DB2 
        JDBC driver)

1680919 failure to export cvs/excel on mac osx (incomplete ClassPath entry in
        Info.plist)

1679998 DOUBLE PRECISION is rounded with locale datatype setting

1675787 Bad link in Online Help

1672207 Create Data Script - PostgreSql.  PostgreSQL requires insert statement 
		boolean values to be literal strings "true" or "false", instead of 1/0.

1660412 Create insert script hangs on explicit Oracle DATE fields (A bug in the
		the SQL parsing routine would hang the thread when the word "from" 
		appeared in a column name in the select statement)

1659412 TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE shows as <Unknown (-101)> - Support was added
        for rendering values of columns with this Oracle-specific type.

1646886 (SQL Bookmarks: Duplicate parameters show as duplicates in the dialog box)
        Now parameter that appear multiple times in an SQL statement do not 
		result in multiple entry fields in the boolmark run dialog.

1643307 Title is missing in Save-Dialog (When ending a session for file saves)

1617839 Two new lines with white spaces in between do not separate SQLs when 
        SQLs are executed without selection.

1639680 Cannot export smallint and decimal to MS Excel

1635259 Session menu has two items with mnemonic "T"

1639662 Block comments can be ended prematurely
        (Thanks to Sam Polak for the patch)

1631392 (Dropping materialized views) - The 'Drop' menu item has been replaced
        by a 'Drop Table(s)' menu item available with the Refactoring Plugin.  
        The new menu item allows the user to specify whether or not to cascade 
        constraints as well as being able to see the SQL that will be executed.

1471672 Float numeric field precision loss in output (DBMS:Oracle)

1447227 Object tree should refresh when changing object tree filters

DBCopy Plugin 
  - If the source/dest database is Oracle, and the type of column being copied 
    is DATE, then treat it like a TIMESTAMP for reading or writing the value.  
    Oracle stores a time component in date columns and this change prevents the 
    time component value from being lost if the destination database can also 
    store a time component in DATE columns.

Derby Plugin  
  - Transformed trigger source tab contents into valid SQL that can be used 
    to re-create the trigger.  
  - Fixed multiple bugs that occurred in the source tab when the same 
    view/trigger name is used in multiple schemas.

Informix Plugin 
  - Fixed to work with IDS 9 - qualified references to all system views by 
    prefixing them with the string 'informix.' (no quotes).
  - Fixed ordering segements within the body of Stored Procedures.  
  - Applied code formatting to triggers and view source.  
  - Fixed erroneous inclusion of extra whitespace which for some definitions 
    made the SQL invalid.

Oracle Plugin
  - Fixed a memory leak where the plugin was holding on to closed sessions

Refactoring Plugin 
  - 'Drop Column' action now properly delegates db-specific drop column command
    to the appropriate dialect for the session.
  - Now allows precision and scale for new or modified columns to be set to 0.
  - The scrollbar in the column list dialog now appears, where previously it 
    did not, making tables with many columns difficult to work with for 
    Add/Modify/Drop column. 


2.4 (12/31/2006)
================

    New Features/Enhancements:

Note: This is the first release of SQuirreL that specifically requires JDK 1.5 
or higher to compile and run. The build scripts and the installer now check for 
at least 1.5 before proceeding.

MS Excel export of displayed tables:
  Besides the exporting tables displayed in SQuirreL to CSV files it is now 
  possible to export to MS Excel files. Thanks to AndrÔøΩ Schild for the patch.

Graph Plugin: New right mouse menu item for tables: "View table in Object tree"

Derby Plugin: A new plugin which allows the user to view source for triggers and
views.  Also, detailed information about triggers is available.

Informix Plugin: A new plugin which allows the user to view source for stored 
procedure, trigger and view objects. Also provides Informix-specific details 
for indexes and triggers.  Special thanks goes to Doug Lawry for help setting 
up an Informix instance for developing the plugin, and providing the system 
catalog queries necessary for the object information provided by this plugin.

Refactoring Plugin: A new plugin which currently allows users to alter
tables by adding, modifying and dropping columns as well as adding/dropping 
Primary Keys.  Uses an extended Hibernate dialect framework to derive SQL which 
is syntactically correct for the database being modified.

Made SQuirreL work with hxtt drivers. See www.hxtt.com. Thanks to Yonghong Zhao 
for patches.

Oracle Plugin:
   Windows for
    - DB Output, 
    - Session Info,
    - SGA Trace,
    - Invalid Objects
   were changed in the following ways:
   - Tool bar buttons are not in the main frame tool bar any more but in the 
     Session tool bar.
   - Each window has its own tool bar icon.
   - All windows restore their last size and position.
   - All windows provide a "Stay on top" check box.

Syntax plugin: Corrections/Abreviations allow new lines. Use \n to create a 
new line. Note: Bookmarks are more powerful than abreviations.

SQuirreL paths (-home, -user) are shown in Global Preferences

LAF Plugin: Added Napkin Look and Feel (JDK 1.5 only)

Completion Popup (Code Completion ctrl+space, Tools Popup ctrl+t, 
Bookmarks Popup ctrl+j): When the beginning/end of the pop up list is reached 
another arrow up/down jumps to the last/first entry. 

1015274: Provided better DB2/400 system naming support

1602255: 'Interpret DATE columns as TIMESTAMP' also in SQL view.  When this 
configuration item is checked, any SQL query result that contains a DATE column
will show the DATE values as TIMESTAMP values (This is useful with Oracle where
DATE columns also contain TIME components)

Schema refresh on catalog combo box change:
Schemas are refreshed automatically, when the user switches to another catalog.
On systems that support Catalogs like Sybase or MSSQL, Schemas within a Catalog 
only become accessible when the catalog combo box is switched to the their 
Catalog. To make Schemas available in the Object Tree, Code completion etc. 
after a Catalog switch Schemas are now automatically refreshed.
(Thanks to Stan Berka for this patch)

Graph Plugin:
The Graph plugin now allows to save jpg images to files instead of printing them.
The image files are an exact copy of what would be sent to a printer and
can easily be used within other applications.
(Feature requested by David Karr)

DBCopy Plugin: Added support for Informix and HADB.  Relocated dialect framework
to core to allow other plugins to use (Refactoring) - this version is now no 
longer compatible or supported for previous versions of SQuirreL.

Re-organized the table and view context menus so that the SQLScripts 
plugin menu items now appear under the "Scripts" menu item and in the
same order that they appear in the session menu "Scripts" menu item.

Updated Spanish translation strings (Thanks to Diego Schulz)

Added JDBC driver CLASSNAME and CLASSPATH to the Metadata tab so that
it is not necessary to open the driver definition for the current session to 
get this information.

	Bug-Fixes:

When reconnecting a Session with the current connection dead
SQuirreL always switched to Autocommit = false state. Now the Sessions
Autocommit state is preserved.


MySQL Plugin: Fixed bug which caused the MySQL all of the tabs to appear with no
content.

SQL editor function "View Object at cursor in Object tree" (ctrl+B) now works
for fully qualified object names with leading and trailing quotation marks and 
slashes.

Oracle plugin: Fixed the rendering of details/source tabs for indexes
sequences and triggers.

Added support for Informix way of referring to database objects within 
catalog and schema as catalog:"schema".objectname.

DBCopy plugin:
  - Removed reflective code used for backward compatibility which was causing 
  IllegalAccessExceptions when the keyword test was applied to column names.

  - Fixed bug in copying FK constraints which left cursors open by not properly 
  closing ResultSets when they were no longer needed.

  - Fixed bug in copying FK constraints where the primary key table 
  name wasn't fully qualified the schema of the destination database.  This was 
  most noticeable when copying tables with FKs into a schema which was not the 
  default schema for that session.

  - Fixed bug where cancelling the copy operation during table data transfer 
    did not also cancel the transfer of table constraints.

1601610 - Bug while editing integer/long columns
  
1598162: Fixed the issue when using Java 6 you had to click the Connect button 
twice when the app is first started.

1597463: Maximized and multimonitor window size not saved

1595913: Cannot select SQL dropdown under java 6.

Added logic to prevent the MacOS X plugin from loading if not on the mac 
platform.  It causes the Global Preferences menu item to disappear when it is 
loaded and the platform isn't Mac

Look and Feel Plugin: Plastic Look and Feels (JGoodies) weren't available anymore.

"Make Editable" on single table SQL did not work when SELECT list contained new lines.

1554175: (Aliases lost on close) 
1532997: (NullPointerException when trying to save alias)
1522229: (Error occurred saving Alias Definitions java.lang.NullPointer)
Many people complained about this one.  At first we determined this was low 
priority since it didn't seem to be reproducable on all jvms. We inadvertantly 
changed the SQLDriverPropertyCollectionBeanInfo such that it no longer 
accurately described the bean SQLDriverPropertyCollection.  in 1.4.2_05 this 
triggered an NPE bug in the jvm code (Introspector.addPropertyDescriptor) which 
caused the SQLAlias persistence to fail, leaving the user with no aliases.

1584283: (DBCopy plugin - Copying LOBs from Oracle to Oracle fails)
If destination column type is Types.OTHER (1111), try to get 
the type name and map it to a valid java SQL type (such as 
Types.BLOB or Types.CLOB).  This only works when the database column
type name as reported by the JDBC driver is a standard type such as 
BLOB, VARCHAR, CLOB, CHAR, etc... A mapping exception is thrown 
otherwise.

1584260: (DBCopy plugin - Fix for issue where the same table is found in 
multiple schemas/catalogs that the user has access to.  Now we specify catalog 
or schema if the driver claims to support them.)

1577254: Trigger details tabs aren't rendered

1532857: (DB2 on AS400 table list not shown) Incorporated Colin Bell's patch 
to address this issue which causes SQuirreL to give '*ALLUSR' for the schema
value when calling DatabaseMetaData.getTables.

1520156: changed the function of the configurable ref actions checkboxes for 
SQLScript plugin.  Now, they will override what is contained in the 
DatabaseMetaData if checked.  If not checked, we now use whatever the database 
tells us the ref action is (before we weren't bothering to check the with 
the database.  Now we do, by default)

1508503: (Double entry for each column fields): Don't add the column to the 
list if it is already there - uses the fully qualified version of the column, 
so may still see duplicate columns with different types.

Bug Fix: Editing data in multiple tables would sometimes fail erroneously with
an error message like "This row in the Database has changed since you 
refreshed the data. No rows will be updated by this operation".

Bug Fix: Solved issue where tables were not appearing in the object tree for
Sun HADB (High-Availability Database).  Special thanks to Lars Heill of Sun
Microsystems, Inc. for technical assistance with installing/configuring HADB.

2.3 Final
=========

Enhancements:

An Italian translation of SQuirreL labels/messages is now available in the 
installer (Thanks to Ivo Neri)

Bug Fixes:

1563613: Alias property window dies when URL is malformed.

1563610: (Only connection specified DB schema loaded regardless)
         Enhanced the catalog selection so that changing the catalog 
		 updates the schema info and expands the TABLES node in the tree
		 for the selected catalog.

1563603: ORA-01830 error: Date format

1561293: Show Loaded Drivers Only" does not work in "Add Alias" dialog.

1558509: 'create sequence' rejected as invalid SQL

1520156: (Reverse Engineering Foreign Key Cascade Missing).  Added 
		 configuration for referential actions clause of FK constraints.

1426012: PLAN_TABLE not found - look for PLAN_TABLE in other schemas and allow
         user to choose one.

1371587: Not possible to edit data after SQL query
         
1250855: (Oracle DATE does not display correctly) Added a new configuration
         item to Global Preferences -> Date Type Controls -> Date Section
		 which allows the user to "Interpret DATE columns as TIMESTAMP".

Bug Fix: Fix for issue where the SGA Trace view wasn't displaying data in the 
	     "Buffer Gets per Row" column.

2.3 rc2
=========

    New Features/Enhancements:

Feature Request #1556226: New menu items in the right mouse menu of tables -
   "Adopt all column widths" - Adopts all columns widths of current table to 
                               header/data.
   "Always adopt all column widths" (check box) - Widths are automatically 
                                                  adopted for all tables opened 
                                                  in the future.

New menu-item "Export CSV" in context menu of table contents spreadsheet allows 
the user to choose whether to use formatting from Global Prefs or default 
formatting.

SQL result tabs offer to rerun their SQL query to update their data.

Text limit line of Netbeans editor can now be positioned or switched off in 
Session Properties.

    Bug Fixes:

1448738: (JDK 6.0 regression) This appeared to be a bug in the Java 6 SE, but it
         turned out that we weren't using the correct method to load classes from
         the ClassLoader.  Sun "fixed" the method (ClassLoader.loadClass) that 
         we were using previously so that it no longer worked as it did in 1.4 
         and 1.5.  For details see:
         http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6446627
         We rectified the problem in SQuirreL by following Sun's suggestions 
         regarding which API methods are being called.

1544447: (Generated SQL script Table names are not fully Qualified, it should
		 be "SCHEMA"."TABLE_NAME")  Added a new global preference panel and 
		 checkbox to make this alternative behavior configurable.  The default
		 now is to qualify table names with their schema name.

1541154: (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in DataTypeDouble)

1533824: (NPE when loading keywords from DatabaseMetaData) Check the values
         returned for null before attempting to parse and store them 
         (DB2 driver returns null for getCatalogTerm())

Bug fix: When doing a complete refresh (F5) or a refresh item in the Object tree 
         (see right mouse menu) code completion was not refreshed. 

Bug fix: In Oracle Plugin - Avoided open cursors when viewing database output 
						    ( dbms_output.put_line() ).

Bug fix: Stored procedures where not shown in Object Tree when the 
         Oracle Plugin was used.

Bug fix: When a Schema was created and the Object Tree was refreshed the new 
         Schema was not shown. 

Bug fix: In Alias properties for Oracle - 
  Note: This bug took effect when default Alias properties were used.
        So this fix probably increases Session startup performance for Oracle 
        users who use the Oracle plugin but do not care for Alias properties.
  Bug: When an Alias was configured to load all Schemas and cache non
       but the Oracle Alias properties didn't allow to load all schemas
       SQuirreL still did load all tables and procedures from the database.
       Though the unallowed tables and procedures did not show up in the Object 
       tree they still caused bad startup perfomance.
  Fix: Now only tables and procedures for allowed schemas are loaded.

Bug fix: Object tree table tab titles were not being internationalized as 
         their values were hard-coded and not available in 
         I18NStrings.properties files.  Now they are.

    Installer Changes:

Three new translations were added to the installer:
	Simplified Chinese (Thanks to xpdz)
	French (Thanks to Erwan Duroselle)
	German (Thanks to Andreas Oswald)

Added new optional plugin (DBCopy) to the installer which allows database tables
and their content to be copied from one session to another inside of SQuirreL
using Copy/Paste menu items.


2.3 rc1
=========


If an Alias is configured to Auto Logon but has wrong user name/password
  on connecting the user gets an error dialog and has to correct user name/password.
  For convenience the corrected data now is written back to the Alias.
  Note: The Writing back is only done when the Alias is configured to Auto Logon.  


Session startup performance
  General: New Alias properties allow to configure loading and caching of Schemas.
  Oracle: When the Oracle Plugin ist used an Oracle tab in Alias properties enables you
          to allow an Alias's Sessions only to see Schemas the user has access to.


Fixed bug #1504123: Oracle hints losts
  By default SQuirreL treads /*...*/ as comments and removes them before sending a SQL to a database.
  This default may now be changed in the (New) Session Properties. See Menu File --> New Session Properties --> Tab SQL.


Added toolbar button to toggle auto commit

Bug fixes in Oracle Plugin:
  - Explain Plan not visible in Results tab
  - Object tree: Sessions, Users and Instances and nodes sometimes not visible
  - Object tree: SYS Schema displayed twice for certain user rights
  - Fixed Memory Leak (Session were not garbage collected when Oracle Plugin was used)


Fixed bug #984527: Right mouse popup menu is now available in empty table. 

Feature request #1446675 Output tables to CSV files
  All tables' right mouse menus have an 'Export CVS ...' item.
  In the export dialog you may provide an application (like OpenOffice calc or MS Excel)
  to open the CSV file immediately after creation.

New toolbar button: Select current SQL (control Shift S)
 This function is based on SQuirreL's concept of 'current SQL': If there is no selected text the current SQL
 is the text between the empty line in fornt of cursor position and the empty line after cursor position.
 Any function that deals with SQL is aware of this concept.

Installer now includes the following optional translation packages:
- Brazilian Portuguese (contributed by Francis Martin)
- Czech (contributed by Jan Kostrhun)
- Bulgarian (contributed by Ivan Dimov)

Feature request #1441787 Quickly adopt column widths to column values
  when table header is double clicked while the resize mouse pointer (<-->) is visible. (MS Excel like)  

Enhancements of the Bookmarks Plugin
 - Bookmark preferences can be opened by the "Edit Bookmarks" button in the Session toolbar.
 - Bookmarks can be run from within the Bookmark Preferences.
 - Lots of "SQuirreL Bookmarks" which are templates for many common SQL/DDL statements.
 - User can decide if he wants to see "SQuirreL Bookmarks" in the Bookmarks selection popup of the SQL Editor (ctrl j).

Fixed bugs in error and syntax highlighting:
 - Error highlighting for "ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT ..."
 - Error highlighting for "CREATE VIEW ..."
 - Error and syntax highlighting for "CASE [...] WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE .. END"


Centralized Database Meta Data caching. This brings along the following improvements:
- When a DDL statement is run the Object Tree is updated immediately to reflect the change.
  This works as long as standard DDL statements are used.
- Syntax coloring and code completion for newly created tables, views, columns, procedures is available
  right after a DDL statement was run. This works as long as standard DDL statements are used.
- The Refresh button updates the Object tree as well as syntax highlighting and code completion.


Make the status message for rows affected by executing an SQL statement in the SQL panel
take into account the type of SQL query issued.

Fixed Bug #1472398: Content tab filters didn't work with views.


Fixed Bug #1465707: Programm slow with big Databases because reading Database Meta Data twice.
                    Technical detail: The SchemaInfo class has become SQuirreL's central meta data cache. 

Fixed Bug: SQuirreL crashed during building output of SQL results when errors occurred in number-type or date-type fields.

Fixed Bug in Graph Plugin: In zoomed graphs lines with folding points could not be selected.


2.2 Final
=========


- Fixed Bug #1467671: Session Properties / General / Appearance: "SQL Results Tabs" overwrites
                     "SQL Execution Tabs" setting.

- Fixed Bug #1464361: Windows bat file is location specific (Thanks to Bill Wallace)

- Fixed Bug #1456423: Cannot cancel a query. Changed to allow the cancel operation to interrupt the
                     fetching of results.  While resolving the "hanging" of a long-running this also
                     allows results that have been fetched so far to be displayed.
                     This can help the user determine why the query was taking a long time to execute.
- Fixed Bug #1447231: ESCAPE key should close dialogs

- Fixed Bug #1457811: Autocomplete does not work for views when tables and view names match.

- Fixed Bug for Teradata not showing SQL results. (Thanks to Matthew Dahlman)

- Fixed Bug #1456463: update to allow the user to override the closing of a session in the event that
                    there are unsaved edits and they decide not to save them right away.  They can
                    always choose to not save and discard, closing the session immediately. This
                    change will make it so that if they choose to not discard, and something happens
                    during the save that causes the edits not to get saved, the session will not be
                    closed.  Added independently configurable options to warn when closing a session
                    if there are any unsaved edits (optional for File or Buffer).  If the
                    "Confirm Session Close" option is turned off, these can still be enabled so that
                    unsaved edits are never lost merely by closing a session.  Previously it was very
                    easy to lose changes made in the SQL edit tab when the session was closed.  This
                    previous behavior, if desired, is still available via Global Preferences.

- Fixed Bug #1441169: error in removing a deleted row more than once.

- Fixed Bug #1250514: Mysql Error: Cannot edit table.

2.2 RC1
=======

- There is now a printer icon in each SQL entry panel which will allow 
  the current sql script to be send to a printer.  Syntax highlighting
  is preserved.  SQL entry panel size is used to scale the font.

- Feature request #1441563 Query script generation:
  New entry for tables and views in the Objects tree's right mouse menu to create SELECT statements.  

- Added menu item and supporting capability to the SQLScripts plugin to 
  create a drop table script from the selected tables in the object tree.

- Added new property for drivers - website url - and a new menu item for 
  drivers to launch the system default web browser and load the driver 
  website url.

- When adding a new driver definition, SQuirreL will now look at the default 
  driver list and determine if any driver defs are missing from the user's
  personal list.  If so, SQuirreL will prompt the user to add them.

- MSSQL plugin: Scripting of procedures now works on MSSQL 2005

- Improved performance of the Session window when connecting to a database
  over a slow link (especially Oracle).  Instead of freezing the window, now
  SQuirreL indicates the progress of the session connection in the session
  frame status bar and allows the user to perform other tasks in parallel.
  Note: The session frame close button is temporarily ignored when the session
        is still loading and therefore not in a safe state to be closed. Once
        the session has been loaded, the close button will be re-enabled.

- Keyboard short cuts are shown in tool bar tool tips.

- Navigation through SQLs in SQL Editor by tool bar or Alt up/down keys.
  Note: The concept of an SQL in SQuirreL is the text between two empty lines. Many 
        functions in SQuirreL use this concept.  This way the user often doesn't 
        need to mark the text he wants to execute a function on.
        The concept is especially convenient for the Run SQL function (control Enter).

- Introduced Oracle specific code to allow editing of tables in Oracle that contain Date columns.
  Oracle stores time information in java.sql.Types.DATE columns. The where clauses that SQuirreL
  used to create to update data after editing only contained the Date part of those columns. That's why
  the where clause didn't match the database row and editing failed.

- SQL Editor: ctrl+backspace deletes word behind cursor.

- SQL Editor: To upper/lower case function available in tools pop up or by short cut ctrl+shift+u/l

- Row numbers in SQL result and Object Tree tables tables:
  Use the right mouse menu in SQL result tables or Object Tree tables to switch on row numbering.

- Improved handling of detached result windows:
  * By default result windows stay on top. A check box in the result window allows to change the default.
  * Result windows show up in the window list of the Windows menu and can be navigated to by Alt+left/right arrow.

- Added New, Close and Append icons/actions to allow the SQL Panel to function more
  like an editor.

- Added "Delete Records" menu item to the context menu for tables to delete all records
  in one or more selected tables.

- Installer now includes an optional Spanish translation package which provides native
  labels and messages for use in a Spanish locale.

- Cleaned up copying from tables:
  1. Control+c and copy in the right mouse menu now do the same: They copy data without column headers.
  2. A new right mouse menu entry ('Copy with headers') provides the ability to copy data including
     column headers
- Fixed bug #1450856: The "new" button has no icon  
- Fixed bug #1448345: Canceling "Save As... " option (overwrites file anyway)
- Fixed bug #1424828: Not possible to clear Non-nullable fields using backspace
- Fixed bug #1423029: Session window will not close for Postgresql
- Fixed bug #1409055: Copy as HTML in results tab does not set correct mime type
- Fixed bug #1403462: MS SQLServer Plugin throws NPE
- Fixed bug #1401672: NullPointerException when selecting Row IDs tab
- Fixed bug #1399254: Missing i18n strings
- Fixed bug #1370186: SQL Editor discards changes when session is closed
- Fixed bug #1385270: Dropping multiple selected tables produces exceptions
- Fixed bug #1256021: Refresh item on a table showing the row number does not update the row count
- Fixed bug #1230126: ClassCastException when editing table data for tables with short and long column
- Fixed bugs #1043604 and #1043599: Unlocalized decimal separator caused problems when data was pasted
                      for example to Open Office Calc. In the Global preferences the user is now able
                      to chose the Java default format for floating point values or the localized form.
- Fixed bug # 863673: cannot DROP TABLE
- Fixed bug # 887525: When Object Tree Nodes are the selected by keystrokes the selected node is scrolled
                      to visible.
- Fixed bug # 763347: Alias and Datasource loss on crash. Files are now written to a temp file first and
                      then renamed.

- Fixed bug: In Code Completion, the database-dependent keywords where missing
- Fixed bug: In code completion, columns weren't shown correctly when the same table alias name was used
             in different statements for different tables (Thanks to Abhishek Gupta)


2.1 final
=========

- Fixed bug #757354 Aliases not reordering on change: Introduced sort button in Alias window tool bar.
- Fixed bug #732696: Dump application success window title and Dump application file filter.
- SQuirreL is ready for internationalization. The new I18n plugin supports translations.
  Put the Plugin in your Plugin path, restart SQuirreL and open the Global Preferences dialog.
  There you'll find a new tab named I18n. Follow the instructions there.
- Fixed bug #1386916 (Informix 3.0 JC3 is considered "not JDBC 2.1 compliant) The
  algorithm for detecting non-compliance incorrectly concluded non-compliance if the
  database doesn't support save points.
- Oracle Plugin: Added access to SYS schema in the object tree for non-privileged
  users since this is where the user-oriented DDL information tables and views are located.
- Fixed bug #1377304: Ant-built distributions do not preserve file permissions
  (Thanks to Charles Albrecht)
- Fixed bug #1376981: SQL Scripts plugin fails to create table script for Axion DB.
- Fixed *ugly* bug in editing SQL results:
  To reproduce the bug you had to have two editable SQLs for different tables. Execute the first
  and edit some results. Close the result tab. Execute the second SQL. Editing of this
  result would fail. The reason was that SQuirreL reuses result tabs but did not properly initialize
  them before reuse. Because of this editing could feel terribly instable when some results had been closed
  and SQuirreL began to reuse tabs.
- Sizes of Properies and Preferences windows are restored.
- Made Syntax highlighting work for: Data Types, Functions, Operators, Identifiers, White Spaces
- Fixed bug #1276957: Oracle protocol violation.
- Oracle Plugin (v0.15) - If the user doesn't have the DBA privilege, then only loads the
  schemas in the object tree to which the user has been granted access.

2.1 rc2
=======

- Bug fix: If SQLs are saved to a file the Session window's title bar displayed an error message instead of
  the alias and file name.

- Bug fix: If two Sessions are open and one is closed the one left open lost key bindings
  which means that for example arrow navigation keys don't work anymore.


2.1 rc1
=======

- Selecting a code completion with tab (instead of enter) will delete the string between the carret position and the next white space.
- New Session properties to configure code completion for functions. Examples: {call myFun(<IN Integer myParam>} or plain myFun()

- Fixed memory leaks. The memory panel in the status bar now tells which Session are garbage collected.
  Use JDK 1.5.x for better memory behavior.

- Fixed several problems when reconnecting an open Session. (See menu Session --> reconnect)

- Improved Exception handling and new Log panel in Status bar:
  SQuirreL's: exception/log handling had two problems:
  i. Exceptions could easily occur without being logged.
  ii. It was hard for users to get aware of logs. The only way was to regularly open the logs window.

  It is taken care now that all exceptions are logged. The user is notified that a log was produced by the
  new Log panel in SQuirreL's status bar. A traffic lights color of the last log is displayed on one of the
  Log panel's buttons.  The last log color is displayed for 5 seconds and is then turned bag to white.
  This allows the user to have an eye an the logs without much disturbance.
  The buttons of the Log panel allow the user to view the last Log and to open the logs window.

- New Memory panel in Status bar.
- Cleaned up SQuirreL logs
- Made Swingset's Aqua Look and Feel available
- Fixed bug: No line counter label on SQL Worksheet (opened by ctrl+n)
- Fixed the following Exception on Sybase when the Object tab was used:
  java.sql.SQLException: "..."."dbo"."..." not found
  (Thanks to Gupta, Abhishek)
- Added "cut/copy SQL to be executed" function to the editor. Since SQuirreL knows the concept
  of SQL text without selection (from caret position between previous and next empty line),
  these functions are short hands for the usual copy and cut which only work on selected text.
- Fixed deleting rows from editable SQL result and from contents tab (ArrayIndexOutOfBounds)
- Fixed bug #1331445: Line comments could change SQLs.
- Patch #1326472 - Oracle plugin is smarter about accessing restricted tables as an unprivileged user
  (Thanks to Alexander Buloichik)
- Bug fix: Limited rows/SQL - hints on top of a result tab could be corrupted (for example multi lined) because of missing HTML escaping.
- Improved messaging for driver definition.
- Bug fix: Driver Icon did not update when driver was changed.
- Added IBM DB2 Net driver to default drivers.
- The source SQL statement used to create a view is now available via the MS SQLServer plugin.
- Patch #1324774 The source SQL statement used to create a view is now available via the
  Oracle Plugin (Thanks to Alexander Buloichik)
- Added Session Property "load columns in background". This option might help people who feel that the SQL editor
  hangs because they use databases with a lot of objects and/or use low data transfer rates.
- Configurable warning for JDBC API version mismatch between the JVM and JDBC driver
- Fixed bug #1316903 (SQL Panel hangs when Ctrl-B on whitespace)
- Added comment/uncomment functions to the SQL editor.
- Made auto corrections and duplicate line available outside the Netbeans editor.
- Bug fix: Code completion did not work when object was directly preceded by =,> or <. Example: Table1.col1=Tab...
- Enabled code completion when a ' or a " is on front of the name to complete (RFE 1305802)
- Fixed bug #1288519 (Postgres: editing boolean fields)
- Fixed for table and tree row height for large fonts. (Thanks to Mitch Skinner)
- User may define an Object tree filter through the Session Properties. Useful for large databases. (Thanks to Oliver Jehle)


2.0 final

- Fix for not shown SQL result on derby DB
- Right Mouse Menu on SQL result tabs (Not working on JDK 1.4 with scrollable tabbed panes due to Bug #4465870.)
  Functions also available in tools popup
- Session property: Limit SQL result tabs.
  By default limiting is switched on and set to 15 tabs.
- Fixed Bug #1234642 (Missing query numbers in message panel)
- When executing a SQL batch (several SQL's separated by statement separator)
  in case of an error the errornous SQL is printed to the message panel.
- From within the SQL Editor one can jump to the Object at cursor in the Object tree.
  To do so use the ctrl+B shortcut or the right mouse menu or the tools popup (ctrl+T)
- New Session property: 'Write SQL Execution Errors to log file'.
  The execution errors of an SQL statement shown in the message panel
  may now also be written to the squirrel-sql.log file
- Fixed bug #1244287 (white space after statement)
- Fixed bug #1217765 (Editing table data for tables with BIT column type)
- Mnemonics for Main Tabbed Pain
- Fixes in editing SQL Results:
  Editing didn't work when a column was in the select list twice
  Editing didn't work when a column was when the statement was like 'SELECT * FROM MyTable ORDER BY MyID'
- Added new Global Preference to show the plugin files being loaded in Splash Screen on startup

========

Enhancements
------------
- Added "Reformat XML" popup menu option to show formatted XML in a column
  (Gerd Wagner).
- User may identify specific columns to use in WHERE clause when editing
  cells in table by using the "Limit cell edit WHERE clause size" entry in

  are automatically split across multiple pages both horizontally and
  vertically (Glenn Griffin).
- The "Session Properties"->"Format" screen has been moved to "Global
  Preferences"->"Data Type Controls", and many new controls have been added
  to adjust how specific data types are used or displayed. (Glenn Griffin)
  Examples:
	- Some DBs do not allow LONGVARCHAR to be used in the WHERE clause, so this
	  may now be disabled
	- Dates, Times and Timestamps may be displayed and entered in a
	  user-selected format
	- Strings containing newlines may display the newlines as "\n" or not show
	  them as selected by the user.


Bug Fixes
---------
- Close metadata result sets once they are no longer required.
- Fixed bug where inserting/updating and deleting rows in the SQL tab would
  loop (Gerd Wagner).
- Fixed bug where setting the statement separator to an empty string then
  wouldn't allow you to change it to anything else (Gerd Wagner).

1.2beta5
========

Enhancements
------------
- added the 'IS NULL' and 'IS NOT NULL' to the choices for operator in
  the Where Clause panel (Maury Hammel).
- When the 'add' button is pressed to put a Where Clause construct into
  the text area, the 'Value' text area is cleared (Maury Hammel).
- Enabled wrapping and added JScrollPanes to the Where Clause and Order
  By Clause text areas, so Panels behave better where large values are put
  in them (Maury Hammel).
- You can now specify whether JDBC logging uses the deprecated output stream or
  the new writer (Neville Rowe).
- You can now filter the catalogs displayed in the object tree (Keith
  Mashinter).
- You can now specify whether to load schemas/catalogs in the object tree
  (Keith Mashinter).
- You can now specify whether to load result set metadata when executing an SQL
  (Keith Mashinter).
- You can Import/Export cell data to/from files and operate on that data with
  external commands (e.g. VI, etc) (Glenn Griffin)
- BLOBs and CLOBs are now fully editable, as are all of the most common SQL
  types (Glenn Griffin).
- Data that can be edited only in the Popup (ie. not in the cell) is now shown
  with a Cyan background to tell the user that it can be edited, but only in
  the Popup (Glenn Griffin).

  Lundberg).
- Fix resource strings (Dennis Lundberg).
- Do a better job of handling MS SQL server catalog names that contain periods.
- Strings (VARCHAR and CLOB) fields containing newlines would loose those
  newlines if edited within the cell.  In-cell editing of that data is now
  blocked (Glenn Griffin).
- SQL problem with WHERE clause being too long (table has too many columns)
  fixed by allowing user to select specific columns to use in WHERE.

Other
-----
- New API ISession.addToToolbar(Action action) added (Gerd Wagner).
- Don't default to displaying the Contents Tab for a table. This can cause
  performance issues when looking at SQL Views (Gerd Wagner).


1.2beta4

- The title from the wrong column was used in the popup window for a columns
  data if the columns in the table had been resequenced (Joseph Boyd).
- Allow for SQLException thrown by HSQLDB 1.7.1 on ResultSetmetaData.isSigned.
- If the columns in a table were resequenced and then the data was copied to
  the clipboard then the column headings in the clipboard were in the wrong
  order (Joseph Boyd).
- Entries in the catalogs dropdown are now sorted.

Other
-----
- Move DataCache class to fw classes.
- Add StringManager class to allow strings to be stored in property
  files rather than hardcoded. Once this is used throughout the
  application it will mean that SQuirreL can be internationalized.
- Add jGoodies Forms library for building GUIs.
- Use Apache CLI library for processing command line arguments.
- New method in SQL execution listener 'allStatementsExecuting'.
- New API allowing plugins to add/remove items from the status bars.

- Contents tab has been made the default when first displaying table in
  Object view (Glenn Griffin).

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fix for selecting which SQL gets executed. When the cursor is on a line in
  the SQL entry that contains at least part of aan SQL statement then only that
  SQL statment should be executed.
